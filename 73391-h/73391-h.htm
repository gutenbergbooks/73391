    <h2>PREFACE.</h2>
  </div>
  <hr class="short">

  <p>White of Selbourne has somewhere expressed the gratification which
    would be afforded to him by a sight of the <i>hirundines</i> of the
    “hot and distant island” of Jamaica. We know, in fact, exceedingly
    little of the <em>biography</em> of tropical animals—of those details
    of their habits, which are to be known only by a close and continued
    observation of them in their woodland homes. The present volume may
    perhaps contribute an acceptable item to the amount of information,
    derived, as it is, entirely from original investigation. Nearly two
    hundred species of birds are thus ascertained to belong to the Jamaica
    Fauna, though of several of these, the author can give only indications
    more or less precise. He cannot doubt that many species have escaped
    the researches both of himself and his friends, especially among the
    migrant visitors. The valuable assistance, however, of a resident
    Ornithologist, whose notes <em>pervade</em> this volume, and to whom he
    would here express his deep gratitude, have greatly diminished the
    omissions which must otherwise have been unavoidable.</p>

  <p>Perhaps a word of apology may be thought needful for the minuteness
    with which the author has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span> sometimes recorded dates, and other
    apparently trivial circumstances, in his observations. It is because of
    his conviction, that an observer is hardly competent to determine what
    circumstance is trivial, and what is important: many a recorded fact
    in science has lost half its value from the omission of some attendant
    circumstance, which the observer either did not notice, or thought
    irrelevant. It is better to err on the side of minuteness than of
    vagueness.</p>

  <p>The author takes this opportunity of proffering his cordial thanks
    to those friends in Jamaica who kindly assisted his investigations;
    and particularly to Andrew G. Johnston, Esq., of Portland, and George
    Wilkie, Esq., of Spanish-town.</p>

  <p>The history of this species has been so ably written by Wilson
    and Audubon, that I shall do little more than touch on one or two
    disputed points in its economy. An excellent memoir of this Vulture,
    communicated to me by my valued friend Richard Hill, Esq., of
    Spanish-town, affords some interesting particulars:—</p>

  <p>“Notwithstanding it forms so common a feature in our landscapes, being
    seen every day and every where, on the mountain as well as in the
    plain, in the city as well as in the country, the Aura is not common
    to the West Indies. It exists in Cuba and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>Trinidad, but is unknown in
    Hayti, and in all the intermediate islands of the Caribbean chain. We
    are no doubt indebted for it to an accidental colony blown over to us
    from Cuba, and Cuba herself owes it to some stray visitants from the
    neighbouring continent of Florida. Some similar fortuity imparted to us
    in common with Cuba, from America, its naturalized hive-bee, which is
    said to have been, at comparatively a late period, an introduction into
    St. Domingo.</p>

  <p>“Those who ascribe the power which the Vulture possesses of discerning
    from a distance its carrion food, to the sense of seeing or to the
    sense of smelling, <em>exclusively</em>, appear to me to be both in
    error. It is the two senses, exerted sometimes singly, but generally
    unitedly, which give the facility which it possesses of tracing its
    appropriate food from far distances. * * * * I shall relate one or
    two occurrences, which seem to me to be instances in which the sense
    of seeing and the sense of smelling were sometimes separately and
    sometimes unitedly exerted by the Vulture in its quest for food.</p>

  <p>“A poor German immigrant who lived alone in a detached cottage in
    this town, rose from his bed after a two days’ confinement by fever,
    to purchase in the market some fresh meat for a little soup. Before
    he could do more than prepare the several ingredients of herbs and
    roots, and put his meat in water for the preparation of his pottage,
    the paroxysm of fever had returned, and he laid himself on his bed
    exhausted. Two days elapsed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span> this state of helplessness and
    inanition; by which time the mass of meat and pot-herbs had putrefied.
    The stench becoming very perceptible in the neighbourhood, Vulture
    after Vulture as they sailed past were observed always to descend to
    the cottage of the German, and to sweep round, as if they had tracked
    some putrid carcase, but failed to find exactly where it was. This led
    the neighbours to apprehend that the poor man lay dead in his cottage,
    as no one had seen him for the two days last past. His door was broken
    open; he was found in a state of helpless feebleness, but the room was
    most insufferably offensive from something putrefying, which could not
    immediately be found, for the fever having deprived the German of his
    wits, he had no recollection of his uncooked mess of meat and herbs. No
    one imagining that the kitchen pot could contain anything offensive,
    search was made everywhere but in the right place: at last the pot-lid
    was lifted, and the cause of the insupportable stench discovered in the
    corrupted soup-meat.</p>

  <p>“Here we have the sense of smelling directing the Vultures, without
    any assistance from the sense of sight, and discovering unerringly the
    locality of the putrid animal matter, when even the neighbours were at
    fault in their patient search.</p>

  <p>“Some few days succeeding this occurrence, after a night and morning
    of heavy rain, in which our streets had been inundated to the depth
    of a foot, and flood after flood had been sweeping to the river the
    drainage of the whole town,—a piece of recent offal had been brought
    down from some of the yards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> where an animal had been slaughtered, and
    lodged in the street. A Vulture beating about in search of food, dashed
    in a slanting direction from a considerable height, and just resting,
    without closing his wings, snatched up the fresh piece of flesh, and
    carried it off.</p>

  <p>“Here was the sense of sight unassisted by that of smelling, for the
    meat was too recent to communicate any taint to the morning air, and
    the Vulture stooped to it from a very far distance.</p>

  <p>“On another occasion very near to the time when these facts attracted
    my notice, a dead rat had been thrown out, early in the morning, into
    the street, having been caught in the previous night. Two Vultures
    sailing over head in quest of a morning meal, descended at the same
    time, stooping to the dead rat, the one from the south, the other from
    the north, and both seized the object of attraction at the same moment.</p>

  <p>“Here again was the vision, unaided by the sensitiveness of the
    nostrils, directing <em>two</em> birds with the same appetite, at the
    same moment, to the same object.</p>

  <p>“For the next example, I am indebted to the records of a Police Court.
    A clerk in the engineer department at Up-park Camp, brought before
    the magistrates of St. Andrew’s, on the 20th of January, 1840, a man
    who had been beset in the night by the dogs of the barracks. The
    poultry-yard had been repeatedly robbed; and this person was supposed
    to have been prowling after the roost-fowls, at the time the dogs rose
    upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span> him.” This case had been heard, and the man committed to the
    House of Correction, when a complaint was presented against another
    man whom Major G., also of the camp, had detected under similar
    circumstances, and lodged in the guard-house. Two days after his
    detection, “the Major observed some Carrion-Vultures, hovering about
    a spot in the fields, and on sending to see what was the matter, a
    Kilmarnock cap containing a dead fowl, and some eggs, tied up in a pair
    of old trousers, was found very near to the spot, where the prisoner
    was caught. This discovery by the aid of the Vultures confirming the
    suspicion against the prisoner, he was condemned.</p>

  <p>“The last instance that I shall relate is one in which the senses of
    hearing, seeing, and smelling were all exercised; but not under the
    influence of the usual appetite for carrion food, but where the object
    was a living, though wounded animal.</p>

  <p>“A person in the neighbourhood of the town, having his pastures much
    trespassed on by vagrant hogs, resorted to his gun to rid himself of
    the annoyance. A pig which had been mortally wounded, and had run
    squealing and trailing his blood through the grass, had not gone far
    before it fell in the agonies of death. At the moment the animal was
    perceived to be unable to rise, three Vultures at the same instant
    descended upon it, attracted no doubt by the cries of the dying pig,
    and by the scent of its reeking blood; and while it was yet struggling
    for life, began to tear open its wounds and devour it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

  <p>“These several instances, I think, abundantly shew that all the senses
    are put in requisition by the John-crow Vulture in its quest for food.”</p>

  <p>From the facts thus presented by Mr. Hill we gather also, that the
    common opinion is erroneous, which attributes to the Vulture a
    confinement of appetite to flesh in a state of decomposition. Flesh
    is his food; and that he does not pounce upon living prey like the
    falcons, is because his structure is not adapted for predatory warfare,
    and not because he refuses recent, and even living flesh, when in his
    power. If the John-crow Vulture discovers a weakling new-born pig apart
    from the rest, he will descend, and seizing it with his beak, will
    endeavour to drag it away; its cries of course bring the mother, but
    before she can come, the Vulture gives it a severe nip across the back,
    which soon ensures the pig for his own maw. If a large hog be lying in
    a sick condition beneath a tree, the Vulture will not hesitate to pick
    out its eyes, having first muted upon the body, that it may discover
    whether the animal be able to rise; the contact of the hot fæces
    arousing the hog if he be not too far gone. Cattle also he will attack
    under similar circumstances. One of my servants once saw a living dog
    partly devoured by one. The dogs of the negroes, half-starved at home,
    “bony, and gaunt, and grim,” if they discover carrion, will gorge
    themselves until they can hardly stir, when they lie down and sleep
    with death-like intensity. A large dog thus gorged, was sleeping under
    a tree, when a John-crow descended upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> him, perhaps attracted by
    the smell of the carrion which the dog had been devouring, and began
    tearing the muscles of the thigh: it actually laid open a considerable
    space, before the poor animal was aroused by the pain and started up
    with a howl of agony. The wound was dressed, but the dog soon died.</p>

  <p>A notion is very prevalent, that the Vulture refuses the flesh of its
    own kind; or that if there ever be an exception, it is only when the
    stomach of the dead bird is filled with carrion. This I have proved to
    be unfounded. I shot one in August, the body of which I threw out; in
    a very few minutes it was surrounded by others, and the bones picked
    clean, though the stomach was nearly empty, and the body had no odour
    of carrion.</p>

  <p>“The Aura Vultures,” says Mr. Hill, “are often to be observed soaring
    in companies, particularly previous to a thunder-storm. This occurrence
    is commonly remarked, because at almost all other times this species is
    seen solitary, or, at most, scouring the country in pairs. They appear
    to delight in the hurly-burly of transient squalls, gathering together,
    and sweeping round in oblique circles, as the fitful gust favours them
    with an opportunity of rising through the blast, or winging onwards
    through the misty darkness of the storm. The effect which this imparts
    to a tropical landscape at a time when thick clouds are upon the
    mountains, and all vegetation is bending beneath the sudden rush of the
    tempest, as gust gathers louder and louder, is particularly wild and
    exciting. Ordinarily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> however, in the evening, when the sea-breeze is
    lulling, and the fading day-beam is changing like the hues of the dying
    dolphin, they delight to congregate, and career at an immense height.
    At this time they soar so loftily, that they are scarcely discernible
    as they change their position in wheeling from shade into light, and
    from light into shade. They seem as if they rose upward to follow the
    fading day-light, and to revel in the departing sunbeams, as, one after
    the other, the varying hues are withdrawn, or irradiate only the upper
    heavens.</p>

  <p>“There is a salacious predilection of the Aura Vulture for the black
    hen of the poultry-yard, and the black turkey, supported by so many
    well-authenticated instances, that I cannot doubt the fact. It is said
    that the Vulture on these occasions makes its amorous attack with an
    eagerness assuming the character of ungovernable fury. Fear overcomes
    the hen, and the sudden assault terminates in an embrace, from which
    she escapes only to linger and die in a very short time. A sort of
    <i>carcinoma uteri</i> is the consequence. * * *</p>

  <p>“This is altogether a curious and very unaccountable fact. Those
    who know how difficult it is to bend instinctive nature, and induce
    the union of animals different and yet similar, will perceive the
    perplexity in which this occurrence is involved. The only link of
    relationship in these events, is the very distant similitude of colour;
    for the unnatural predilection is restricted to fowls of black plumage.”</p>

  <p>I may add that on my reading the above notes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> of my friend, I mentioned
    this statement to my negro servants, both of whom assured me that the
    fact was indubitable, and well known; and each of them averred that he
    had witnessed its occurrence.</p>

  <p>The dimensions in the note, p. 1, were those of the largest of two
    adult males of the ordinary size, which, however, is considerably less
    than that of continental specimens. The tongue is singularly formed,
    and may be termed spoon-shaped; or rather it is a half-tube, curved
    in its length, having its edges, which are bony, cut into minute and
    beautifully regular teeth, pointing backwards. The skin of the head
    is naked, except some small scattered hairs, and falls on the occiput
    into ten or twelve transverse wrinkles; its colour varies in the same
    individual, being sometimes purple, then in a few minutes bright red;
    when dead, it is a dull lake-pink. The feet are scaly, white; or
    rather dull reddish, covered more or less with a white scurf; the red
    hue is most apparent at the upper part of the tarsus; the claws are
    horny black. Immediately in front of the eye is a series of irregular
    tuberculous excrescences of a dull white, varying in extent.</p>

  <p>Like many black birds this Vulture is subject to albinism. There was a
    pied one, which for a long time had been occasionally seen in company
    with others over Bluefields and the vicinity. I at length invited him
    with some flesh, and lying in wait, shot him. The white feathers were
    promiscuously interspersed, chiefly on the shoulders, breast, upper and
    under tail-coverts, and wing-quills; some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> the longest primaries
    were wholly, others partially, white; but the wings were not uniform
    in the distribution of the colours. This individual was recognisable
    almost as far as visible; for the white was very pure. Some, however,
    are found much more completely white than this; my negro lad, Sam, had
    seen one which had the wings wholly white except some of the least
    coverts; and the breast also white.</p>

  <p>The situations usually selected in Jamaica by this Vulture for the
    laying and hatching of its eggs, are hollows and ledges of rocks in
    secluded places, or inaccessible crags and cliffs. A little dry trash
    or decaying leaves, are all the apology for a nest. A young one taken
    in such a situation, and brought to me in May, was nearly full-fledged,
    but bore little resemblance to the adult. The whole body, with the
    exception of the winglet, the wing quills, and the tail, was clothed
    with down of the purest white, while the naked head with the beak was
    black. The eyes, as usual in young birds, were blue-grey. It smelled
    strongly, unbearably, of musk; was very fierce, tilting at every thing,
    striking with the wings, and leaping forward to bite. It kept up a
    continued harsh hissing. The nest contained two young, but they had
    begun to wander, though as yet unable to fly.</p>

  <p>This Buzzard, which we learn from Wilson is spread over the United
    States, is the most common raptorial bird in Jamaica. Permanent, not
    migratory, we see it all the year round, sailing deliberately in wide
    circles over the pastures and ruinates, now near the ground, but
    presently soaring into the upper air, each circle higher and higher
    till the bird is lost in the glare of a tropical sky. It is common to
    see two individuals of this species in company, sailing each in its own
    circle, but intersecting the other; and as they thus fly, they utter
    from time to time a sudden energetic cry, “<em>pinyee</em>.”</p>

  <p>The frequency of this bird’s depredations on the poultry of the
    homestead, has given it a provincial appellation. In the stomach of
    one, examined by Wilson, he found, however, the remains of frogs and
    lizards. Its courage is not proportioned to its size or arms. Not long
    ago, near Bluefields, two <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>of these Hawks swooped together upon a white
    barn-door cock, who defended himself so vigorously and so successfully
    as to keep them both at bay for some time, until, help coming, both the
    marauders were shot.</p>

  <p>Some observations of Mr. Hill’s, on the flight of the birds of prey,
    elicited by a few remarks in a letter from a friend, appeared to me so
    interesting, that he kindly placed both in my hands, for the advantage
    of the present work; and I here present them to my readers.</p>

  <div class="center mt2"><cite>Samuel R. Ricketts, Esq., to Richard Hill, Esq.</cite></div>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“With regard to Hawks, I have had many opportunities of observing
      their habits here, as I have a large common, and a flock of
      turkeys. They perform successive circular movements in the air,
      and their pounce is done by closing the wings upwards. They appear
      to be falling, when doing so. A chicken was taken here some days
      ago from the roof of the house, having fallen from the talons of a
      Hawk I was in pursuit of. The South American Hawks fly higher, and
      in larger circles, than those of Europe:—why, I cannot tell, but
      such is the fact. I speak from personal observation. Our Hawk has a
      peculiar note in very dry weather, and is then said by the negroes
      to be “calling the rain.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="center mt2"><cite>Richard Hill, Esq., in Reply.</cite></div>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Your observation about the widened circuit which the Hawks of this
      country, and those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> South America generally, take when surveying
      their prey, has led me to trouble you with the following remarks on
      the flight of raptorial birds.</p>

    <p>“Raptorial birds that take their quarry on the ground, as we
      very well know, before they seize their prey, attentively survey
      it; keeping it in view by sailing round and round it. In these
      circumgyratory evolutions they leisurely gaze down on their
      intended victim, and then descend circle by circle, to pounce on it
      with a swoop.</p>

    <p>“The attention of birds in ordinary or direct flight is immediately
      fixed on the objects before them. The swiftness with which they
      shoot through the air makes every visual impression indistinct
      and evanescent on either side of them. If they take wing for a
      distance, they rise at once high, that they may command a view
      of the place which they intend to visit; and if they proceed to
      an object that is near, they elevate themselves to such a height
      only as is necessary to give them a clear and direct course to
      where they are speeding. The circular flight of raptorial birds,
      is therefore the result of their directing their vision to the
      centre of the gyrations they describe in examining their prey, or
      descending upon their victims.</p>

    <p>“The eye of all birds is large and prominent. The prominence widens
      the field of vision. The width of the circle which the several
      kinds of raptorial birds variously describe, I think, as a rule,
      will be found to be determined by the size of the head and position
      of the eyes, or increased with the rotundity of the head of the
      bird. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> direct vision being altered with the increase of space
      between the eyes, Hawks of the Buzzard kind, which have large and
      round heads, may be expected to wheel in wide circles; the expanded
      space being required, that they may keep the vision of their
      wide-apart eyes direct upon the objects beneath them.</p>

    <p>“Owls fly differently. They search for their prey, as if they were
      pursuing it with the vigilance of the hound. They skim along the
      surface of the earth, glide among trees, explore avenues, sweep
      round, rise and fall, wheel short, and dart down, but never sail
      in circles. Their wide staring eyes are placed in what may be
      called their face, being right forward in front, and have scarcely
      any field of vision laterally. They therefore hunt with a forward
      and downward gaze, like dogs over a field. The globe of the eye
      of these nocturnal <i>raptores</i>, being immoveably fixed in the
      socket by a strong elastic cartilaginous case, in the form of a
      truncated cone, they have to turn their heads to view objects
      out of the path of flight, and their neck is so adapted for this
      exertion, that they can with ease turn round the head in almost a
      complete circle, without moving the body.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I have never met with the nest of this Hawk; nor has Wilson given us
    any information concerning it; but a young friend, very conversant
    with out-of-door natural history, informs me that he lately knew of
    one, a large mass near the top of an immense cotton-tree into which he
    observed the old birds frequently go. It was at Content, in the parish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
    of St. Elizabeth. The gigantic dimensions assumed by the <i>Ceiba</i>,
    which strike a stranger with astonishment, combined with the smoothness
    of the trunk, rendered its summit perfectly inaccessible, and prevented
    particular examination. At length he witnessed the emergence of two
    young ones, and their first essay at flight. He assures me that he
    distinctly saw the parent bird, after the first young one had flown a
    little way, and was beginning to flutter downward,—he saw the mother,
    for the mother surely it was,—fly beneath it, and present her back and
    wings for its support. He cannot say that the young actually rested
    on, or even touched the parent;—perhaps its confidence returned on
    seeing support so near, so that it managed to reach a dry tree; when
    the other little one, invited by the parent, tried its infant wings in
    like manner. This touching manifestation of parental solicitude is used
    by the Holy Spirit in the Song of Moses, to illustrate the tenderness
    of love with which Jehovah led his people Israel about, and cared for
    them in the wilderness. “As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth
    over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them
    on her wings; so the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange
    God with him.”—(Deut. xxxii. 12.—See also Exod. xix. 4.)</p>

  <p>The only individual of this species that has fallen under my notice is
    a preserved specimen, now before me, which was obtained and prepared
    at the Pedro Kays, about the end of March, 1846. The rocks so named,
    of which I may have an opportunity of speaking more at large, are
    situated about sixty miles to the south of the western end of Jamaica,
    forming the prominent points of a large shoal, which is marked on
    the old Spanish charts as the Vibora bank. The islets or kays are
    the habitation of immense numbers of sea-fowl, especially Boobies
    and Terns; and the eggs of the latter form no unimportant article of
    commerce. Several small vessels are annually sent from Kingston and
    other ports, in the month of March, which return loaded with eggs: and
    parties are often made by sporting gentlemen, to enjoy the pleasure of
    shooting on these desert rocks.</p>

  <p>It is to the politeness of George Wilkie, Esq., who visited the Kays in
    the past Spring, that I am indebted for the present specimen, shot by
    him.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

  <p>In the United States this bird is found to prey principally upon ducks,
    which it appears to strike with its feet, but allows to drop to the
    ground before it secures them. If, as is probable, its predilection
    extends to other aquatic birds, its presence at the Pedro Kays, where
    such prey abounds, on which it may riot undisturbed, is not surprising.
    But, as the period of its occurrence is that of the migration of many
    species of ducks from the Spanish main to the United States, our bird
    may have been a follower, with predatory intent, of some of the many
    bands of migrant ducks which were passing the rocks about that time.</p>

  <p>The Prince of Canino has separated this species from the Peregrine
    Falcon of Europe, with which it was supposed to be identical. The
    European bird, which was renowned as the Tiercel and the Faucon of
    falconry, is inferior in its dimensions to our species.</p>

  <p>Though of small size, this bird is not lacking in spirit and courage,
    often striking at prey nearly as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>large as itself. It hovers about
    the savannas, frequently flying very near the grass or bushes, but
    it seems to have favourite resorts. In the guinea-grass piece of
    Mount Edgecumbe, which stretches along the sea-shore from Belmont
    to Crab-pond, there are several hoary cotton-trees, (<i>Ceiba
    eriodendron</i>) of giant size, around which I have rarely failed to
    see more than one of these little Hawks. From one to another of these
    they sail on graceful wing, usually alighting on a prominent branch,
    near the summit. One which I shot from such a station, manifested no
    alarm at being aimed at, but peeped down as if its curiosity were
    excited. The smaller pigeons form the principal prey of this species;
    but sometimes it appears to be unequal to the conquest of its quarry.
    My lad observed a Hawk, one day, chasing a Pea-dove, which at length
    took refuge in a low bush, but was followed by the Hawk; the shaking
    of the bush showed that a struggle was going on, which seems to have
    terminated in favour of the gentle Dove, for presently both emerged,
    the Dove flew off, and the Hawk alighted on a tree close by; this same
    individual, being shot and wounded, fought bravely with both beak and
    feet, drawing blood from the hands of its slayer.</p>

  <p>The Anis are acquainted with his prowess, and indicate their fear by
    loud cries of warning to their fellows, huddling away to the nearest
    bush. The Petchary and Loggerhead Tyrants are often pursued by him, but
    often escape; for it is remarkable, that if his swoop is ineffectual,
    he does not repeat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> it, but flies off. I have seen one descend upon a
    flock of Tinkling Grakles, causing the whole body to curve downward
    in their flight, and alight on a neighbouring tree. But it is said to
    feed, in lack of better prey, upon beetles and dragonflies.</p>

  <p>This species, which is a summer visitant of the United States, is a
    permanent resident in Jamaica; but I know nothing of its nest.</p>

    applies the term <em>cinnamon</em>, to the parts which I designate as
    <em>umber</em>. Three individuals, all females, have at separate times
    come into my hands, two of which were immature, as manifested by the
    downiness of the plumage. One of these was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> brought me on the 31st of
    March by a man who obtained it on Bluefields Mountain. He was engaged
    in felling a tree, in which the bird was; being disturbed it flew to
    another at a short distance, when it was struck down with a stick. The
    time was about noon. The person informed me that he had seen the bird
    there before, in company with another, which he supposed to be its
    mate. The stomach of this specimen, a large muscular sac, was filled
    with an immense quantity of slender bones, which appeared to be those
    of Anoles, as I discovered by the iguaniform teeth of at least five
    sets of jaws, of various sizes. They were enveloped in a quantity of
    fetid, black fluid. There were also the remains of beetles, and of
    orthopterous insects.</p>

    <a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Dr. Anthony Robinson, a surgeon practising in Jamaica
      about the middle of the last century, accumulated a very large mass of
      valuable information on the Zoology and Botany of the island, which is
      contained in five folio MS. volumes, in the possession of the Jamaica
      Society at Kingston. The specific descriptions, admeasurements, and
      details of colouring are executed with an elaborate accuracy worthy
      of a period of science far advanced of that in which he lived.
      Accompanying the MSS. are several volumes of carefully executed
      drawings, mostly coloured. To these volumes I have been indebted, as
      the reader will find, for many valuable notes, which I thus acknowledge
      with gratitude.

  <p>Of another, the adult from which my description was taken, struck
    down while sitting on a mango tree at Tait-Shafton, on the morning
    of April 6th,—the stomach was stuffed with the hair and bones of a
    portion of a rat, and the legs of a large spider; a <i>Lycosa</i>, as I
    believe—certainly a ground spider. Most of the eggs in the ovary were
    minute, though some were as large as mustard-seed; by which I gathered
    that the period of incubation was yet distant, though the spring was so
    far advanced.</p>

  <p>The third I had the advantage of seeing alive: one whose downiness
    indicated youth, was brought me on the 24th of the same month. Its
    imbecility by day was shewn by the mode of its capture. It was in a
    small tree on Bluefields Mountain, when a boy, by shaking the tree,
    caused it to fall to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> ground, where it lay helpless. It was cross
    all the time I had it, snapping the beak loudly, and striking out as
    endeavouring to seize the hand; uttering now and then a shrill wail,
    most plaintive to hear. The globular head, and round full eyes, over
    which the nictitating membrane was constantly being drawn, gave the
    living bird an odd appearance. On dissecting it I found in the stomach
    remains of mice and elytra of small beetles.</p>

  <p>From these instances we can pretty well infer the food of the present
    species to consist largely of shelled insects, as well as lizards and
    small mammalia. For a while I knew not what to make of a statement of
    Robinson’s, that in his male he found “nothing but some particles of
    maize;” as also that in another, with “the remains of scarabs,” there
    was “some guinea-corn, and maize.” But I am informed that this Owl is
    known to enter dove-cotes, and devour the young pigeons; the grain,
    therefore, in these specimens was probably in the stomachs of their
    prey, and remained in the Owls after the prey had been dissolved,
    because the stomach of a rapacious bird refuses to digest vegetable
    food. It would probably have been cast up, if the birds had survived.</p>

  <p>I know not whether this is the species that Mr. Hill means when he
    says, in “Notes of a Year,” published in the Companion to the Jamaica
    Almanack, for 1840,—“After sunset [in evenings in August] the Brown
    Owl, seated on the dead limb of a tree in some savanna, makes little
    circuits of about thirty feet diameter, and returns to perch again. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
    should judge that it is darting at Coleopterous insects, occasional
    fire-flies being seen wandering at about ten or a dozen feet above the
    highest elevation at which the Owls are flying.”</p>

  <p>The flesh of this species is soft and flabby in texture, and pale in
    colour.</p>

  <p>Though Wilson has introduced this bird into his American Ornithology,
    and described it apparently from native specimens, his very meagre
    notes of its manners are those of its European representative, the
    bird being very rare in the United States. In Jamaica it is not at all
    uncommon, though little seen by day. I have been accustomed to see
    one nearly every evening, emerge from some lofty woods on a hill just
    above Bluefields, soon after sunset, and fly heavily over the pasture
    and house, uttering a querulous cry, <em>kep, kep, kep</em>, in a sharp
    tone, without intermission. Sometimes it was followed by another, and
    both would betake themselves to a large cotton-tree at the border of
    the opposite woods, where they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>would alight on the topmost boughs,
    and after sitting quiet awhile, resume their flight and their cry
    together. At other times, one or two are heard, and dimly seen by the
    light of the moon, slowly flying over the pasture in a large circle.
    Its motion is noiseless in itself, but almost always accompanied by
    this monotonous cry; it usually flies high, but remarkably slowly. I
    had been informed that it sometimes screams shrilly when flying, but
    this I had not heard, until I had been familiar with the bird in this
    way, for more than a year. But one night as I lay awake at Content, in
    St. Elizabeth’s, I heard a harsh screech twice repeated, which I at
    once suspected to be the voice of the White Owl, and presently this was
    confirmed by the <em>kep, kep</em>, of one which was evidently flying
    round the house, and continued for some time within hearing. And one
    evening, about three months afterwards, just as the west horizon had
    faded from its glowing gold to a dull ruddy hue, I heard a Screech Owl
    flying from the hill as usual over the pasture; when it was overhead,
    but at a height of perhaps three hundred feet, it suddenly intermitted
    the <em>kep, kep</em>, by a loud scream; then <em>kep, kep</em> again, and
    soon another scream, and by and by another, as it slowly flew along.</p>

  <p>This Owl does not seem to affect the deep forests, although it haunts
    shady places in the vicinity of estates and open grounds, doubtless
    because in such places its prey abounds. Among these groves it is
    sometimes seen flitting on soft and silent wing during the day, when
    it does not usually cry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> About the middle of October, passing through
    the extensive and beautiful Pen, called Mount Edgecumbe, where the
    smooth-barked pimento trees grow from the grassy sward, as in a park,
    my attention was called to a large space walled in, which my negro lad,
    Sam, told me was a “Spanish hole.” Curiosity led me to examine it. On
    getting over the wall, which was only a fence of dry stones, to protect
    the cattle from falling in, I found myself in an area of about eighty
    feet in diameter, in the centre of which yawned a vast pit nearly
    circular in form, about forty feet wide, and as many in depth. The edge
    overhung in every part, consisting of sharp limestone rock, so that
    there seemed at first no means of getting down. Some trees, however,
    were growing from the bottom, a few being of large size, and all of
    great height and smoothness, almost wholly of one kind, the bread-nut
    (<i>Brosimum alicastrum</i>). On carefully searching round, we found a
    slender tree growing so close to the edge as to afford a ready means of
    sliding down by, but so smooth that Sam was very reluctant to essay it,
    doubting his power to climb up again. It was with a hope of finding it
    the resort of owls or bats, that I had determined to examine it, and
    while we were discussing the possibility of reascending, a large White
    Owl suddenly flew up, and after flitting round once or twice, sailed
    away towards the woods. While I was peering into the remote corners, I
    discerned on a huge flat rock beneath the cavernous sides, what seemed
    a young bird, snow-white, and of large size, together with several
    eggs. This made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> me more urgent on my lad, and after much persuasion,
    and the promise to procure ropes, and assistance without delay, in case
    of need, he at length sprang off, and slid down the tree. By means of
    a long and tough smilax, which I afterwards used to measure the depth,
    I passed down to him in succession the gun and the basket; and he
    proceeded to explore the dungeon. It was evidently formed by nature;
    for from the overhanging sides depended stalactites of various sizes
    and forms, in points and festoons, some of the smallest of which he
    broke off; they were of a rough dead-white surface, but the fracture
    displayed shining crystals. In one corner were two or three holes of
    less than a foot in diameter, into one of which he thrust a stick
    several yards long; it met no bottom, and on being let go, instantly
    slid out of sight. In another corner lay some immense masses of stone,
    so large, as to leave a comparatively small space beneath the rocky
    roof. On one of these lay the object of the enterprise. The lad having
    clambered up the rocks, was saluted on his approach by a loud hissing
    from one of the ugliest creatures he had ever beheld; so that he
    hesitated to touch it. I encouraged him, however; for from the top I
    could witness all that took place; and he at length opened the basket,
    and with a stick tumbled the young bird in. Not the least vestige of a
    nest, nor of any apology for one, was there; but the bird had reposed
    on a broad mass of half-digested hair, mingled profusely with the bones
    of rats and birds; half of a rat lay there, freshly killed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> the fore
    parts being devoured. At a little distance from the bird lay, on the
    same mass, three eggs, in no wise to be distinguished from those of
    a hen, in form, size, or colour, save that they were scarcely equal
    to the <em>average</em> size of hen’s eggs. I may add that, on emptying
    them afterwards, I found them to contain only a fluid apparently
    homogeneous, glairy, but turbid, like very thin paste. They were not
    collected for sitting, neither being within six inches of another. No
    sooner had Sam descended, than the old Owl again appeared; but, after
    flying round the mouth of the pit, and settling for an instant on one
    of the trees, she flew off again; and though, when we had secured the
    young and eggs, we waited long in expectation of her return, she came
    no more while we remained. Having passed up the things by the brier,
    the lad <em>shinned</em> up the tree without much difficulty, and we
    proceeded home with our young charge. On taking him out, I found him a
    strange figure indeed: the head long, and sparingly clothed with down;
    the curved beak, with its flesh-coloured cere; the immense orbits of
    the eyes marked by a white ring of small down, and the top and back
    of the head, and all the body besides, thickly clothed with white
    down of exquisite softness, strongly reminding me of a hair-dresser’s
    powder-puff. The tips of the wings displayed the budding quills, but
    they bore the singular appearance of flesh-coloured tubes, crowned with
    a divergent tuft of down. The hinder parts were, as usual in young
    birds, large and protuberant, and there was not a vestige of a tail as
    yet. The feet and legs were well developed, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> bird sometimes
    stood up on them, but more usually rested on the whole sole, in an
    upright, but most grotesque attitude. The clothing down was of the
    purest white, except that in a few parts, as the back of the head and
    neck, the shoulders, and the elbow of the wing, it was slightly tinged
    with a delicate buff, hardly discernible. He was a very cross fellow,
    biting spitefully at everything presented to him, and sometimes at the
    boards around him, without any provocation; but the beak, though sharp
    and hooked, was not moved by sufficient muscular power to hurt the
    hand. He was almost constantly hissing; particularly, but not only,
    when approached, giving out a sound, that for character, and really
    almost for volume, may be likened to that produced by the rushing forth
    of steam from the waste-pipe of an engine. While I was bringing him
    home, he discharged from the stomach a hard and very dry pellet, an
    inch in diameter, and about three in length, composed of rats’ hair and
    bones, showing that he was habitually fed with prey as taken, perhaps
    simply divided, and not with half-digested matter from the stomach of
    the mother. I found, however, that though it would bite at any object,
    it had no notion of eating; a bit of flesh seized in the beak being
    invariably dropped in a second or two. I therefore crammed it, giving
    it portions of the bodies of small birds and lizards, forcing them into
    its throat; an operation the less difficult, as the gullet is enormous.
    The portions remained in the fauces for a few moments, and were then
    swallowed. When standing up, or sitting, gazing with apparent curiosity
    at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> person near, it was perpetually swaying deliberately from side
    to side; sometimes it lost its balance and fell over. The irides were
    black, but the pupils pale blue. It lay down to sleep, resting the side
    of its head on the floor.</p>

  <p>In the course of a few days it began to seize food when presented
    to it, which it swallowed eagerly; and I was astonished to see how
    large morsels it would swallow, such as the undivided body of a large
    Noctilio, which it could hardly receive into its mouth. The coloured
    feathers now began to protrude from the lengthening quill-tubes, and I
    perceived that the tuft of down was slightly attached to the point of
    the feather, and was deciduous; or rather, that it consisted of very
    fine and loosely barbed prolongations of the ordinary beards of the
    vane, very closely resembling in texture the barbs of an ostrich-plume.
    When it became a little stronger, so that it could support itself a
    moment on one foot, it began to manifest a singular habit in eating.
    Almost invariably, henceforth, as soon as it had snatched a piece of
    flesh, which it did ravenously, it chewed it a moment with the tips of
    the mandibles; this had the effect of pressing out the morsel on each
    side so that it protruded. One foot was then brought up under the chin,
    and thrown forward with a clutching motion, two toes being on each side
    the beak; this was awkwardly performed, being repeated several times
    before the morsel was grasped; and the bird often stumbled about on the
    other foot, or nearly fell over. When the foot had clutched the flesh,
    it was held in the toes, until the beak could seize it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> a more
    favourable position for swallowing. Then, by repeated tossings of the
    head, the morsel was <em>thrown</em>, as it were, little by little into
    the fauces. All the while it was eating, even when the throat seemed
    quite closed by the descending food, the whistling hiss was maintained
    with incessant pertinacity. Indeed, this sound, harsh and deafening as
    it was, scarcely ever ceased, except when the bird was sleeping. It
    was exceedingly vigilant; the smallest sound, even a light foot-fall,
    would arouse it, and awaken this most unmusical noise. It was more than
    usually loud when the bird was hungry, and doubly so at the moment when
    food was presented to it, as, in its ravenous eagerness to seize, it
    frequently missed from its hurried motion. Sometimes, when its belly
    was full, it substituted a quivering whistle, in a very high key,
    emitted, I believe, through the nostrils. The fæces were very fluid,
    and resembled a thin solution of lime; they left a chalky deposit,
    pulverulent: and were not at all fœtid. It seemed to have no desire for
    drinking. On the 1st of November it died, having been in my care about
    a fortnight.</p>

  <p>Soon after this, my lad Sam being again near the <em>Spanish-hole</em>,
    looked in, and discerned the old Owl sitting on the same spot, and on
    the 12th, I again visited it. On peeping cautiously over the wall, I
    discerned her on the rock, and fired; but merely wounding her, she
    retreated into one of the cavities, so that Sam, on descending, could
    not find her. There were four eggs, which were placed close together,
    but in no nest. Another Owl, doubtless the mate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> flew at the report
    of the gun from somewhere near the margin, opposite to the female’s
    side: but though we made considerable noise in entering the area, and
    in talking, the boy in descending discovered him perched still near the
    margin of the cavern. At length, however, he flew off. As the sitting
    bird had concealed herself, and could not be found, I determined to
    leave the eggs untouched, presuming she would soon return to them.
    In the course of half-an-hour I returned, and had the satisfaction
    of seeing her again on the eggs: I fired, and this time not vainly.
    In her fall she crushed one of the eggs, which had evidently been in
    contact with the skin of her abdomen, that part being wholly denuded of
    feathers. The remaining eggs were advanced towards hatching in <em>very
    different degrees</em>, and one was found on dissection in the oviduct
    of the bird, completely shelled, and ready for deposition. The yolk of
    this was small in quantity, and of a pale yellow tint. Other eggs in
    the ovary were from the size of large shot downward.</p>

  <p>About the middle of October, my notice was drawn to some Owls, which
    were said to make nightly visits to a certain tree in a provision
    ground at Belmont. I visited the spot the next evening, after sunset;
    it was a large cotton-tree, with a spur more than usually immense
    and uncouth. The rounded top of this spur was the scene of the Owls’
    gambols: as I approached, I heard them uttering the same harsh sound,
    half hiss, half scream, that had characterized the young one. As it was
    nearly dark, their white forms were indistinct,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> and before I could get
    within range, they, whose senses were now vigilant and acute, perceived
    me, and flew to a neighbouring tree, whence they presently removed to a
    distance. On the following evening I took care to be on the watch soon
    after sunset: presently I heard the well-known cry <em>kep, kep</em>; and
    the bird, arriving on noiseless wing, took up its station on one of the
    lofty limbs of the cotton tree. It called in this manner for a minute
    or two, when the other came flying from another direction, uttering the
    same sound, and likewise alighted on a limb not far from the former. As
    it was growing dark, and I was anxious to procure specimens, I fired at
    one, and brought it down with the wing wounded. It retreated into one
    of the dark recesses of the spurs, and fought bravely before I could
    get hold of it, snapping the beak, and trying to bite. When brought to
    the house, its attitudes and motions were exactly the same as those
    of the young above described: it would stand for hours on the same
    spot, gazing intently with its large liquid eyes, at any one before
    it: swaying slowly from side to side, with the head depressed and
    protruded, as if to get a better view of the object of its attention.
    If approached, it opened and snapped the beak; but if pressed, it fell
    backward on the tail, presenting both feet to clutch: which it did with
    effect.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hill mentions to me a third species of Owl, small in size, and of a
    brown hue, but I know not any of its generic or specific characters.</p>

  <p>These birds are doubtless migratory, for we see nothing of them from
    September to April. They probably winter with the Grey Petchary and the
    Red-eyed Vireo, in Central America, as they appear with those species
    about the beginning of April. We can scarcely fail to recognise the
    period of their arrival; for their manners and voice are so singular,
    that they force themselves upon our attention. About an hour before
    the sun sets, we hear a loud, abrupt, and rapid repetition of four
    or five syllables in the air above our heads, resembling the sounds,
    <em>piramidig</em>, or <em>gi’ me a bit</em>, or perhaps still more,
    <em>witta-wittawit</em>. On looking up we see some two or three birds,
    exceedingly like swallows in figure and flight, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>but considerably
    larger, with a conspicuous white spot on each wing. They <em>winnow</em>,
    however, rather more than swallows, and more frequently depress one
    or the other side; and the body and tail behind the wings is rather
    longer. Their general appearance, their sudden quick doublings, their
    rushing, careering flight, and their long, narrow, arcuated wings,
    are so like those of swallows, that after being familiar with them,
    I have often been unable to determine at the first glance, whether
    a particular bird were a caprimulgus or a swallow. Like them the
    Piramidig is pursuing flying insects; and though the prey, from its
    great height, and probably its minute size, is invisible from the
    earth, we may very often observe that it is captured, by a sudden
    arresting of the career, and by the swift zigzag dodgings, or almost
    stationary flutterings, that ensue. I do not think the prey is
    ordinarily larger than minute diptera, hymenoptera, and coleoptera;
    for I have not been able to detect anything flying where these birds
    were hawking, even when their flight was sufficiently low to allow of
    insects as large as a bee being distinctly seen. “Mosquito hawk,” is
    one of the appellations familiarly given to the bird, and doubtless
    not without ground. I am confirmed in this supposition, by the fact
    that swallows, whose prey is known to be minute, are usually hawking in
    the same region of the air, and in company with the Piramidigs. By the
    term “company,” however, I must not be understood as implying anything
    like association, which does not seem to exist even between these birds
    themselves; they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> usually solitary, except inasmuch as several,
    hawking over the same circumscribed region, must often come into close
    proximity; but this seems, in general, neither sought nor avoided; each
    swoops on its own course, regardless of his momentary neighbour. Yet
    the tender passion sets aside even the most recluse solitariness in any
    animal; and to this I attribute it that now and then I have seen one
    Piramidig following another in close and pertinacious pursuit, ever and
    anon uttering its singular cry, and evidently desiring to come into
    contact with, but not to strike or hurt its coy companion. I would not
    assert from hence that the nuptials of this species are performed upon
    the wing, because the premises are too slight to decide so important
    a fact; but it is known that it is so with the European Swift, a bird
    whose manners greatly resemble those of our Night-hawk.</p>

  <p>It is when the afternoon rains of the season have descended
    plentifully, that these birds are most numerous, and most vociferous;
    and they continue to fly till the twilight is beginning to fade into
    darkness. After this, they appear for the most part to retire, and the
    strange and startling voices, that before were sounding all around
    and above us, are rarely heard by the most attentive listening. A
    lad informed me that when out fishing during the night, not far from
    the shore, the canoe is often surrounded by bats, which make a great
    noise. But my assistant, Sam, who heard the statement, assured me that
    these were not bats, but Piramidigs, (with some bats, however, in the
    company), and that these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> birds, when the moon is at or near the full,
    continue on the wing through the night.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> On dark rainy days, such as
    we get sometimes in May, I have seen and heard two or three abroad even
    in the middle of the day, careering just as at nightfall.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> I may be permitted here to record a tribute of affection
      to this faithful servant, Samuel Campbell, whose name may often appear
      in this work. A negro lad of about eighteen, with only the rudiments
      of education, he soon approved himself a most useful assistant by his
      faithfulness, his tact in learning, and then his skill in practising,
      the art of preparing natural subjects, his patience in pursuing
      animals, his powers of observation of facts, and the truthfulness with
      which he reported them, as well as by the accuracy of his memory with
      respect to species. Often and often, when a thing has appeared to me
      new, I have appealed to Sam, who on a moment’s examination would reply,
      “No, we took this in such a place, or on such a day,” and I invariably
      found on my return home that his memory was correct. I never knew him
      in the slightest degree attempt to embellish a fact, or report more
      than he had actually seen. He remained with me all the time I was in
      the island, and was of great service to me. Many of the subjects of
      this work were obtained by him, when I was not myself with him, and
      some which I believe to be unique.
  </div>

  <p>Early in the morning, before the grey dawn has peeped over the
    mountain, I have heard over the pastures of Pinnock Shafton, great
    numbers of these birds evidently flying low, and hawking to and fro.
    Their cries were uttered in rapid succession, and resounded from all
    parts of the air, though it was too dark to distinguish even such as
    were apparently in near proximity. Now and again, the hollow booming
    sound, like blowing into the bung-hole of a barrel, produced at the
    moment of perpendicular descent, as described by Wilson, fell on my ear.</p>

  <p>The articulations or syllables, if I may so say, which make up the
    note, are usually four, but sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span> five, or six, uttered as
    rapidly as they can be pronounced, and all in the same tone. The
    Chuck-will’s-widow and the Whip-poor-will of the northern continent
    derive these names from a rapid emission of certain sounds not very
    dissimilar to those of the bird under consideration. The cry is
    uttered at considerable intervals, but without anything like a regular
    recurrence or periodicity.</p>

  <p>Whither the Piramidig retires after its twilight evolutions are
    performed, or where it dwells by day, I have little evidence. The first
    individual that fell into my hands, however, was under the following
    circumstances. One day in the beginning of September, about noon, being
    with the lads shooting in Crab-pond morass, Sam called my attention to
    an object on the horizontal bough of a mangrove-tree, which he could
    not at all make out. I looked long at it, also, in various aspects,
    and at length concluded that it was a sluggish reptile. It was lying
    lengthwise on the limb, close down, the head also being laid close
    on the branch, the eyes wide open, and thus it remained immovable,
    though three of us were talking and pointing towards it, and walking
    to and fro under it, within a few yards. The form, in this singular
    posture, presented not the least likeness to that of a bird. At length
    I fired at it, and it fell, a veritable Night-hawk! The reason of its
    seeking safety by lying close, rather than by flight, was probably
    the imperfection of its sight in the glare of day, from the enormous
    size of its pupils: but the artifice showed a considerable degree of
    cunning.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

  <p>An intelligent person has stated to me that early in the morning,
    where a perpendicular face of rock about twenty feet high rises from
    the hilly pastures of Mount Edgecumbe, he has seen these birds leave
    what seemed to be nests, built in the manner of some swallows, on the
    side of the rock, near the top. But I strongly suspect he is mistaken
    in the identity of the bird. One day, at the end of July, as I and Sam
    were following Baldpate Pigeons on some very stony pasture at Pinnock
    Shafton, much shaded with pimento and cedar-trees, we roused a bird
    of this family, and, I think, of this species, which started from the
    ground near our feet, and fluttered in an odd manner, inviting our
    attention. I was aware of her object and began to search carefully
    among the loose stones for a young bird, or an egg, but could discover
    neither, though I have no doubt either the one or the other was not
    far off. I have been told that it habitually chooses for its place
    of laying, the centre of a spot where a heap has been burned off in
    clearing new ground; perhaps on account of its dryness.</p>

  <p>In some “Notes of a Year,” published in the Companion to the Jamaica
    Almanack, Mr. Hill had used the term, “triangular,” in connexion
    with the flight of this bird. In reply to a question of mine, on the
    subject, he thus writes: “I send you a diagram of the flittings about
    of the Goatsucker. It illustrates my allusion to the triangular flight
    of the bird. This peculiar cutting of triangles struck my attention,
    when I was watching the morning flight of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> some three or four
    Goatsuckers, just at day-dawn, while I strolled through the pastures
    of a pen in St. Andrew’s, where I was visiting. The morning twilight
    had spread a clear glassy gloom over the whole cloudless expanse around
    and above me; and as no direct ray shone on the woods and fields, which
    lay silent and sombre beneath,—the flitting birds were seen distinctly,
    like dark moving spots against the grey sky. I was struck with the
    sudden shifts by triangles which they were seen to make. They never
    moved very far from one to another direction, but darted backward and
    forward over a space of some five hundred yards, preserving a pretty
    constant horizontal traverse, over some trees in a near pasture,
    whose honeyed fragrance on the morning air told that they were in
    blossom. Occasionally only, they rose and sank so as suddenly to change
    their elevation above the clumps of foliage. Yarrell observes that
    Goatsuckers are remarkable for beating over very circumscribed spaces;
    but I have not found any one who notices their cutting in and out by
    triangular shifts. It is not so perceptible in the obscurity of the
    evening, but in the perspicuousness of day-dawn it is plainly visible;
    and I made a note of it, and dotted in the angular appearance at the
    time.”</p>

  <p>In some parts of Jamaica this bird bears the appellation, most absurdly
    misapplied, of “Turtle-dove:” it is occasionally shot for the table,
    being usually fat and plump. It is a very beautiful bird. The stomach,
    protuberant below the <em>sternum</em>, is a large globular sac; the
    other viscera are small.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> Of one which I dissected, shot in its evening
    career, the stomach was stuffed with an amazing number of insects,
    almost (if not quite) wholly consisting of small beetles of the genus
    <i>Bostrichus</i>: there were probably not fewer than two hundred of
    these beetles, all of one species, about a quarter of an inch long.</p>

  <p>The primaries, which are long and narrow, have a peculiar downy
    surface, like the nap of cloth, extending down the inner vanes, and
    covering the outer two-thirds of their breadth; this is visible only on
    the upper surface. It does not exist in our Nyctibius.</p>

  <p>There is in my possession, presented to me by Mr. Hill with many other
    interesting objects, an egg of much beauty, which, when brought to him,
    was reported to be that of a Caprimulgus. It certainly belongs to this
    family, but not, as I think, to this species, judging from Wilson’s
    description. Its dimensions are 1²⁄₁₀ inch, by ⁸⁄₁₀, of a very regular
    oval, polished, and delicately and minutely marbled with white, pale
    blue grey, and faint olive.</p>

  <p>Both the Whip-poor-will and the Chuck-will’s-widow have been assigned
    to Jamaica; neither of these vociferous and unmistakable birds,
    however, have fallen under my observation there. It is not improbable
    that the present bird has been mistaken <span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>by careless observers for the
    Chuck-will’s-widow, though comparatively a silent species.</p>

  <p>The Potoo is not unfrequently seen in the evening, taking its station
    soon after sunset on some dead tree or fence-post, or floating by on
    noiseless wing, like an owl, which the common people suppose it to be.
    Its plumage has the soft puffy, unwebbed character which marks that of
    the owls, and which prevents the impact of its wings upon the air from
    being audible, notwithstanding the power and length of those organs.
    Now and then it is seen by day; but it is half concealed in the bushy
    foliage of some thick tree, which it can with difficulty be induced
    to quit, distrustful of its powers by day. As it sits in the fading
    twilight it ever and anon utters a loud and hoarse <em>ho-hoo</em>, and
    sometimes the same syllables are heard, in a much lower tone, as if
    proceeding from the depth of the throat.</p>

  <p>The first specimen that fell under my observation was shot in October.
    On several evenings in succession a large bird had been observed
    sitting on a particular post near Bluefields Tavern, where it remained
    undisturbed by passers looking at it, though it was not half a stone’s
    cast from the road-side. At length Sam shot at it, and blew out many
    feathers, but it flew slowly off to the woods; uttering, the instant
    after it was shot, a low croaking. The next evening he watched again,
    and about sunset the bird returned to the same post, when he secured
    it. It is interesting to observe the similarity in habit to the
    Flycatchers in selecting a prominent station, and returning again and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
    again to it, even after such annoyance. It was one out of many posts of
    a rail-fence, yet the bird uniformly chose the same. Another was given
    me a few weeks afterwards, which had been struck down with a stone, as
    it was sitting on a tree in the yard around a negro’s house. It had
    been in the habit of stationing itself there every evening, and its
    cries, which were described to me as resembling the mewing of a cat
    in pain, were so plaintive, that they seem to have acted on the good
    woman’s superstition, who begged her husband to kill it. I incline
    to think, however, that the voice here mentioned was not that of the
    Potoo, but of an Eared Owl which may have been near it, but in the
    darkness unobserved. This specimen lived a day or two in the house,
    after it was knocked down, and when it died it was brought to me. I
    found its stomach, a muscular gizzard, distended with large beetles,
    (<i>Megasoma titanus</i>,) disjointed. That of the former contained two
    specimens of a black <i>Phanæus</i>.</p>

  <p>Another, a male, shot in the day time, in February, had the stomach
    hard stuffed with fragments of insects, which, on being dispersed
    in water, I found to consist wholly of beetles, among which limbs
    of <i>lamellicorns</i> were conspicuous, probably <i>Phanæus</i>.
    In this case the stomach was more membranous; the œsophagus very
    wide and substantial as in the Owls, but there was no dilatation or
    proventriculus.</p>

  <p>About the same time a living and uninjured specimen was given me,
    taken in a wooded morass.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> This I kept some days. It would sit
    anywhere that it was placed, across the finger, or across a stick;
    never <em>lengthwise</em>, though I repeatedly tried it so. Its position
    in sitting was quite perpendicular, (that is, from head to tail,)
    the plumage a little puffed out, the head drawn in, the eyes usually
    shut. When pushed, however, it lengthened the neck to retain its
    balance, and opened its eyes, which being so large, and the irides
    of a brilliant yellow, combined with the wide gape to give it a most
    singular physiognomy. Usually it seemed absolutely blind by day, for
    when the eyes were wide open, the approach of any object within a line
    of the pupil, and the moving of it to and fro, produced, in general,
    not the slightest effect. Once or twice, however, I observed that when
    the pupil was greatly dilated, as it always was when the lids were
    first unclosed, the sudden motion of my hand towards the eye, caused
    the pupil to contract with singular rapidity to less than one fourth
    of its former dimensions. Afterwards by candle-light, I observed the
    extraordinary rapidity and extent of this contractility more fully.
    When the candle was little more than a yard distant, the pupil was
    dilated to about ³⁄₄ths of an inch diameter, occupying the whole
    visible area of the eye, the iris being reduced to an imperceptible
    line; on bringing the candle close to the pupil, it contracted to a
    diameter of two lines, and that <em>completely within the period</em>
    required to convey the candle by <em>the most rapid action of my hand
    practicable</em>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

  <p>As night approached I expected that it would become animated; but
    it did not stir, nor shew any sign of vivacity, though I watched it
    till it was quite dark. Several times in the evening I went into the
    room, up to ten o’clock, but it was where I had left it. About three
    in the morning I had occasion to go in again with a candle; the Potoo
    had not altered his position, and when the day came, there he was
    unmoved, nor do I believe he had stirred during the whole night. Thus
    he remained during the next day; I put his beak into water, and let
    fall drops upon it, but he refused to drink: I then caught beetles
    (<i>Tenebrionidæ</i>) and cockroaches, but he took no notice of them;
    and though I repeatedly opened his beak and put the insects into his
    broad and slimy mouth, they were instantly jerked out by an impatient
    toss of his head. Towards this evening, however, he began to glower
    about, and once or twice suddenly flew out into the midst of the room,
    and then fluttered either to the ground, or to some resting place.
    Many little <i>Tineæ</i> were flitting around my dried bird-skins,
    and I conjectured that he might be capturing these, especially as
    when at rest his eye would now and then seem to catch sight of some
    object, and glance quickly along, as if following its course. The
    statement of Cuvier, that “the proportions of the Nyctibius completely
    disqualify it from rising from a level surface,” I saw disproved;
    for notwithstanding the shortness of the tarsi, (and it is, indeed,
    extreme,) my bird repeatedly alighted on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> and rose from, the floor,
    without effort. When resting on the floor, the wings were usually
    spread; when perching, they about reached the tip of the tail. If I
    may judge of the habits of the Potoo from what little I have observed
    of it when at liberty, and from the manners of my captive specimen, I
    presume that, notwithstanding the powerful wings, it flies but little;
    but that sitting on some post of observation, it watches there till
    some crepuscular beetle wings by, on which it sallies out, and having
    captured it with its cavernous and viscid mouth, returns immediately to
    its station. Mr. Swainson appears to consider that the stiff bristles,
    with which many <i>Caprimulgidæ</i> are armed, have a manifest relation
    to the size and power of their prey, beetles and large moths, while
    these appendages are not needed in the swallows, their prey consisting
    of “little soft insects.” (Class. Birds.) But here is a species, whose
    prey is the hardest and most rigid beetles, of large size, and often
    set with formidable horns,—which has no true rictal bristles at all!</p>

  <p>Finding that my Potoo would not eat, and feeling reluctant to starve
    it, I killed it for preparation. In depriving it of life, I first
    endeavoured to strangle it by pressure on the trachea, but I found
    that with all the strength of my fingers, I could not compress it so
    as to prevent the admission of air sufficient for respiration. I was
    obliged, therefore, to apply one or two smart blows on the head with a
    stick. While giving it these death-blows, much against my feelings, it
    uttered, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> being taken up by the wings, a short, harsh croaking. With
    this exception, it was absolutely silent all the time I had it; never
    resenting any molestation, save that when irritated by the repeated
    presentation of any object, as the corner of a handkerchief, it would
    suddenly open its immense mouth, apparently for intimidation; yet it
    made no attempt to seize anything. The stomach, notwithstanding three
    or four days’ fast, was crammed with fragments of beetles, among which
    were the horns of a large <i>Dynastes</i>, that I had not met with. I
    may mention that the sclerotic ring of the eye consists of distinct
    plates (see Pen. Cyc. xvi. 225,) thirteen in number, varying in
    dimensions, and not perfectly regular in form.</p>

  <p>I afterwards kept a living Potoo for ten days; but its manners were
    exactly the same as above, pertinaciously refusing to eat. Mr. Hill,
    however, had one which greedily ate large cockroaches that were thrown
    to it.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable that among a people whose most striking feature is
    the great development of the mouth, the Potoo has become a proverb of
    ugliness. The “most unkindest cut of all” that a negro can inflict upon
    another, on the score of personal plainness, is “Ugh! you ugly, like
    one Potoo!”</p>

  <p>I have seen that which serves this bird for a nest: it is simply
    a round, flat mat, about five inches wide, and little more than
    one thick, composed of the fibrous plant called Old man’s beard
    (<i>Tillandsia usneoides</i>). It was found on the ground on a spot
    whence the Potoo had just risen: it is in the possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> of Mr. Hill,
    to whom I am indebted for the following interesting observations.</p>

  <p>“White’s conjecture of the purpose to which the serrated toe of the
    Nightjar is applied, namely, the better holding of the prey which it
    takes with its foot while flying, would have been more than rendered
    highly probable by an inspection of the foot of the Nyctibius. The
    inner front toe and the back toe are spread out by the great extension
    of the enveloping flesh of the phalanges, to such a breadth as to
    give the foot the character and form of a hand; while the movement of
    these prehensile organs is so adjusted that the back toe and the three
    front toes, pressed flat against one another, can enclose anything
    as effectually as the palms of the hands. The [claw of the] middle
    toe, which is serrated in the Caprimulgus, is simply dilated in the
    Nyctibius, a peculiarity also of the swallows. Whatever deficiency of
    prehension this may give it, when compared to the power of the serrated
    nail of the Caprimulgus, is amply compensated for in the Nyctibius, by
    the palm-like character of the foot, by the extraordinary expansion of
    the toes, and by the quantity of membrane connecting them together. All
    this would be a mere waste of power if it did not perform some function
    like that which White assigned to the foot of the Nightjar.</p>

  <p>“The feathers of the head, but especially those around the dilated
    gape, are of a peculiar structure. The covering of this part appears at
    first sight a mixture of hair and feathers, but upon close inspection,
    it is found to be composed of a loosely woven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> plumage, in which the
    shaft of each feather is prolonged into a pliant filament of great
    length. It is this texture which gives the character of intermingled
    hairs to the feathers around the mouth. This tendency in the shafts and
    in some of the webs also to terminate in filaments is very prevalent in
    the plumage of the Nyctibius, each of the feathers of the tail having
    this sort of termination.”</p>

  <p>The Potoo is a permanent inhabitant of Jamaica; it is common in the
    lowlands of the south side, and probably is generally distributed in
    the island: it is found also in Brazil, for I am quite satisfied that
    Mr. Gould’s <i>N. Pectoralis</i> is not specifically distinct from ours.</p>

  <p>The description below I have quoted (somewhat abridged) from Robinson’s
    MSS., who has given <span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>an elaborately coloured figure of the species in
    his drawings. I have never met with it, but I think Mr. Hill has; for
    he has assured me of the existence of two true Nyctibii in Jamaica,
    besides the common Potoo; and two Caprimulgi, besides the Piramidig. I
    knew not exactly which species are alluded to in the following extract
    from a letter of Andrew Gregory Johnston, Esq., of Portland parish,
    a mountain region, to Mr. Hill. “We have two birds called Patoo; one
    white, the other brown. The first resembles the Scritch-Owl of Europe;
    the last is smaller; it is dark brown, and makes a noise by night, (and
    occasionally by day) half guttural, half pectoral or ventral, sounding
    the monosyllable <em>wow</em>, at short intervals. I have seen a brown
    Patoo <span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>taken by a negro boy in mid-day from a branch of a mango tree,
    with a noose fastened to a short stick. It was young, but a flier.
    Its mother came to look for it, and we caught her, and kept her some
    days. When liberated she would not move off many yards from the house,
    but was seen daily for a few weeks. When a prisoner it would eat
    cockroaches thrown down to it, and if handled was cruel and spiteful,
    otherwise quiet and apparently very gentle. There are plenty of them
    here. I listen to their sulky <em>wow</em>, often in the watches of the
    night.”</p>

  <p>Perhaps the present species may be “the small wood Owle” of Sloane, ii.
    296.</p>

  </div>

  <p>“As this bird seldom alights, it is furnished with two supernumerary
    bones, which are placed on the superior and exterior part of the leg;
    the skin that covers them is of an obscure flesh-colour; they are of an
    oblong ovated form, one fourth of an inch <span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>long; and as the bird hangs
    upon a wall, rock, &amp;c., by his claws, these bones are pressed close to
    it, and the leg thereby secured from harm.</p>

  <p>“The tail consisted of ten feathers, which, when expanded, formed
    a large segment of a circle, somewhat pointed at their ends; the
    innermost ones broadest. It is remarkable in this bird, that the
    tail-feathers have naked shafts after the manner of the woodpeckers,
    and adapted to the same use; for the shafts, being remarkably strong
    and elastic, even to their points, help to support the birds in their
    pendent situation, till they get fast hold by their claws, if there
    is any to be got: if not, they can, by means of their tail, fling
    themselves back, and recover their wings quickly, which might be
    difficult for them to do were the shafts of the tail less strong. The
    points are not only naked but sharp.</p>

  <p>“Mr. Long had this bird alive. I set it upon the floor; it crept along
    with its legs bent, leaning upon the aforesaid bones, but was not able
    to raise itself upon its feet; its legs were not so thick as those of
    our great English Swift. It was remarkably broad-shouldered, measuring
    <em>two inches</em> from pinion to pinion; its head was one inch broad
    between the eyes. It resembled the <i>Caprimulgus</i> of Edwards <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>in
    the form of its beak and body, as also in <em>the largeness of its
    eyes</em>. Its feathers were all glossy.</p>

  <p>“When the tail is half-spread it forms a straight line at the end; when
    more, a curve like a fan. When by any accident this bird falls to the
    ground, it creeps or scrambles to some rock or shrub, where bending its
    tail and expanding its wings, it elevates its body, and at the same
    time throwing its legs forward, catches hold of the rock, &amp;c., with
    its claws, and climbing up to a proper height, throws itself back and
    recovers its wings.</p>

  <p>“This bird was brought to me March 5th, 1759; it had fallen from a tree
    by some accident, and was taken up by a negro, before it could recover.”</p>

  <p>The above notes in some degree arranged, and slightly abridged, I quote
    from Robinson’s valuable MSS., who was evidently much interested in
    the bird he has so minutely described. That interest I myself felt
    in no small degree, on reading his notes, as there appear manifest
    indications of an intermediate link between the diurnal and nocturnal
    Fissirostres. It was therefore with very much pleasure that I saw on
    the 4th of last April, what I believe to have been the present species.
    At Content, in St. Elizabeth, as evening approached, <em>after a little
    rain</em>, swallows of three species were careering around the mountain:
    the White bellied Swallow and the Palm Swift were numerous, and among
    them was a very large black species, with a white collar, rather less
    numerous, prodigiously rapid in flight. I vainly endeavoured to shoot
    it. A fortnight afterwards, about half an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> hour before sunset, <em>after
    rain</em>, the Piramidigs which first appeared were presently joined by
    the great collared Swift, which careered with them in numbers. Again,
    about 11 o’clock in the forenoon, in May, three of these birds swept
    overhead, heavy rain already falling on the mountain, and beginning to
    reach the spot where I was. My lad Sam, one day about noon, observed
    as many as a dozen passing in a flock, in straight and rapid course,
    when black clouds, already gathered round the mountain brow, threatened
    rain, which however passed away to leeward. A few days after, a little
    earlier in the day, and <em>in exactly similar</em> weather, or rather
    amidst the first large drops of a heavy rainstorm, he saw three flying
    so low as nearly to skim the ground; two pursuing in mazy course a
    third, from which proceeded, now and then, a singular vibratory sound,
    which Sam imitated by the word “churr.” This singular sound, which
    again reminds one of the Goatsuckers, was also uttered by two, which,
    about the same season and hour, and in similar weather, were careering
    swiftly over Bluefields towards the mountain peaks.</p>

  <p>Having mentioned the occurrence of this bird to my notice, in a letter
    to Mr. Hill, he favoured me with the following interesting account of
    his own acquaintance with the species. “* * * The month was March, the
    early part of March, when the bleak northerly winds of February had
    exhausted and blighted all vegetation, and the lower range of the St.
    Andrews mountains, with their steep and angular declivities walling
    in the plains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> were looking as seared as if a simoom had blasted
    them. The pastures below were destitute of herbage, but the adjacent
    cane-fields were sufficiently green to relieve the arid aspect of
    the mountains, and give the air of cultivation to the plain. Myself
    and the friend with whom I travelled had waited in Kingston till
    <em>an afternoon shower</em> had fallen. The sun was just setting when
    we had got within the last mile of our journey. We had completely
    headed the extremity of the Long mountain, and were quite within the
    plain, encircled, as it there seems, by hills and uplands. The air
    was pleasant and fresh;—the earth sent up its reeking odour, musky
    and strong;—the road was splashy, and here and there stood puddles
    in the grassless savannas. Lighted by the level sunbeams the whole
    landscape was brilliant, and the masses of recent rain-clouds that were
    up-rolled, but gathered low on the mountains before us, were luminously
    golden and crimson. The deep, desert bed of the Hope river was right
    in our view. Here, all of a sudden, we found ourselves coursing our
    way through a hundred of the White-collared Martin, and they seemed
    to spread all over this corner of the plain in similar numbers. The
    extraordinary size of the birds, the easy but rapid glide of their
    flight, just over the cane-fields and savannas, not at a greater
    height than just above our horse, when they crossed and re-crossed the
    road, sweeping so near to us as to tempt us to strike at them with the
    chaise-whip, were very remarkable incidents in a first acquaintance
    with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> them. I was able to see the whole character of their form and
    colouring, ‘great black Martins, with a white collar,’ as your letter
    delineates them. They continued quartering over the fields, till the
    sunlight had left the plains, or was only reflected by the mountains
    and their piles of roseate clouds. The rain had brought all insect-life
    to the moist surface of the earth, and these birds were following their
    congregated swarms to the wet savannas. They sometimes stooped to the
    puddles, and shot past with a twitter that very much reminded one of
    the summer play of their smaller sized congeners.</p>

  <p>“I have seen the same bird twice or thrice since, but in threes or
    fours only, and, always, only near rocky and unfrequented hills.
    Another friend, who drew my attention to them in consequence of their
    numbers after rains, in his neighbourhood, lived among large open
    savannas and salt-ponds, near the low range of rocky and sterile
    mountains, which our maps call the Healthshire hills. He told me he
    had traced them to the caverns in those mountains, in which he felt
    assured they nestled in hundreds. This is the nearest to any precise
    information, I ever could get of their haunts and habitations.”</p>

  <p>I am not alone in thinking these birds difficult to shoot; a gentleman
    who resides near Kingston, having observed them at his residence one
    evening, the last spring, and kindly wishing to supply me with a
    specimen, though an expert shot, fired five times unsuccessfully at
    them. Yet I am not without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> hope of obtaining specimens, particularly
    through the politeness of Mr. A. G. Johnston of Portland. In answer
    to some observations of Mr. Hill’s, this gentleman writes, “The
    ring-necked Swallow abounds here, and flies all day, just as the other
    Swift does. Flocks of a hundred or two of each, wheel and scream about
    us before a shower. I have a specimen before me, which I stuffed
    sixteen years ago, pretty perfect yet, but I propose to shoot you some
    fresh birds. I find no difficulty in bringing them down, but I never
    saw one alight or perch anywhere.”</p>

  <p>It is with doubt that I identify this bird with the “White-necked
    Martin” of Temminck, found by the Prince de Nieuwied in his voyage to
    Brazil. He states it to be very common in the environs of Rio Janeiro,
    and in all the districts of that province, where “<em>it is found among
    rocks</em>.” Perhaps it is Hirundo 3, of Browne.</p>

  <p>When the above was just going to press, I received from Mr. Hill
    information that a specimen of this bird had been obtained by Mr.
    Johnston. A careful drawing of the left foot accompanied it, with
    the following note. “The legs are curiously constructed: the tarsus
    cannot <em>extend</em> further than here represented, [viz. forming an
    angle with the tibia, of 28°] nor can it be straightened, so that it
    corresponds with the tail feathers, and keeps the bird in an upright
    position against vertical rocks and trees.” Mr. J. ascertained that
    from this formation, the bird cannot stand erect on the ground, nor
    can it apparently walk; and he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> been told that cattle-boys and
    fishermen in Portland both say that they have taken young ones of this
    species <em>clinging</em> to the vertical honey-comb rocks, against whose
    base the sea dashes. As the specimen thus procured is kindly destined
    for me, I hope to speak still more definitely, if it arrive in time, in
    an appendix. Perhaps it may form a new genus.</p>

  <p>Mr. Johnston’s little boys, familiar with Peter Wilkins’s story, have
    been accustomed to call these birds <em>Gowries</em>; because of the
    rushing noise they make with their wings; a noise that is heard even
    when they sweep by, far overhead. I have adopted this appellation.</p>

  <p>This delicately-formed little Swift, conspicuous even in flight,
    from the broad belt of white across <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>the black body, is a very
    common species in Jamaica, where it resides all the year. Over the
    grass-pieces and savannas of the lowlands, the marshy flats at the
    seaward mouths of the valleys, as well as the pens of the mountain
    slopes, this swift-winged sylph daily urges its rushing course in
    parties of half-a-dozen to fifty or a hundred, often mingled with
    other Swallows, performing mazy evolutions, circling and turning,
    crossing and recrossing, now darting aloft, now sweeping over the
    grass, till the eye is wearied with attempting to follow them. The
    length of its wings, which is scarcely less than that of the whole
    bird,—renders it a fleet and powerful flier; an attentive observation
    will be able to identify it, when mingling in aerial career, by a
    more frequent recurrence of the rapid vibration of the wings, the
    momentary winnowing, by which a fresh impetus is gained. There is a
    very interesting structure in the sternum of this bird, which as far
    as I know is unprecedented. The sternum, though void of emarginations,
    possesses two oblong foramina of large size, one on each side of the
    middle of the ridge, and a round one perforating the ridge itself near
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>the front margin. As all three are closed by the usual membrane, the
    object may be, the decrease of weight by the abstraction of bone,
    while the surface for the attachment of the muscles of flight remains
    undiminished. It would be interesting to know whether this structure is
    found in the Collocaliæ of the Indian Archipelago, to which the present
    bird bears a strong outward resemblance.</p>

  <p>The stomach of one, a female, which I dissected, shot while hawking
    among many others over Bluefields’ grass-piece, in April, was distended
    almost to bursting with minute insects, which on being dispersed
    in water, and examined carefully with a lens, proved, I believe
    exclusively, the winged females of a small species of ant, exceedingly
    numerous, all more or less comminuted.</p>

  <p>On the 20th of March last, visiting in company with Mr. Hill the estate
    called Dawkins’ Saltpond, the residence of the Spanish Admiral, at
    the time of the conquest,—I observed several small Swallows flying
    above some cocoa-nut palms; they uttered, as they flew, a continued
    twittering warble, shrill but sweet, which attracted my attention. I
    commenced a careful search, with my eye, of the under surface of the
    fronds and spadices of one, and at length discerned some masses of
    cotton projecting from some of the spathes, which I concluded to be
    their nests. This conjecture proved correct; for presently I discovered
    a bird clinging to one of these masses, which I shot, and found to be
    this White-rumped Swift. On my lad’s attempt to climb the tree, eight
    or ten birds flew in succession from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> various parts, where they had
    been concealed before. The tree, however, was too smooth to be climbed,
    and as we watched beneath for the birds to return, one and another
    came, but charily, and entered their respective nests. Although several
    other cocoa-nuts were close by, I could not discern that any one of
    them was tenanted but this, and this so numerously, whence I inferred
    the social disposition of the bird. At some distance we found another
    tree, at the foot of which lay the dried fronds, spadices, and spathes,
    which had been, in the course of growth, thrown off, and in these were
    many nests. They were formed chiefly in the hollow spathes, and were
    placed in a series of three or four in a spathe, one above another,
    and agglutinated together, but with a kind of gallery along the side,
    communicating with each. The materials seemed only feathers and
    silk-cotton (the down of the <i>Bombax</i>); the former very largely
    used, the most downy placed within, the cotton principally without;
    the whole felted closely, and cemented together by some slimy fluid,
    now dry, probably the saliva. With this they were glued to the spathe,
    and that so strongly, that in tearing one out, it brought away the
    integument of the spathe. The walls of the nests, though for the most
    part only about a quarter of an inch thick, were felted so strongly,
    as to be tenacious almost as cloth. Some were placed within those
    spathes that yet contained the spadices; and in this case the various
    footstalks of the fruit were enclosed in a large mass of the materials,
    the walls being greatly thickened. All the nests were evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> old
    ones, for the <i>Bombax</i> had not yet perfected its cotton, and hence
    I infer that these birds continue from year to year to occupy the
    same nests, until they are thrown off by the growth of the tree. The
    entrance to the nests, which were subglobular, was near the bottom.</p>

  <p>Near the middle of May, my servant Sam, being engaged at Culloden,
    in Westmoreland parish, cutting the fronds of the palmetto
    (<i>Chamœrops</i>) for thatching, found these little birds nestling in
    abundance, and procured for me many nests of the present season. Their
    recent construction, and perhaps the diversity of their situation—for
    instead of the hollow of a spathe, these were attached to the plaited
    surface of the fronds,—gave them a different appearance from the former
    specimens. Many of these I have now in my possession. They have a
    singularly hairy appearance, being composed almost exclusively of the
    flax-like cotton of the <i>Bombax</i>, and when separated, are not
    unlike a doll’s wig. They are in the form of those watch-fobs, which
    are hung at beds’ heads, the backs being firmly glued by saliva to the
    under surface of the fronds, the impressions of the plaits of which are
    conspicuous on the nests when separated. The thickness is slight in the
    upper part, but in the lower it is much increased, the depth of the cup
    descending very little below the opening. The cotton is cemented firmly
    together as in the case of the others, but externally it is allowed to
    hang in filamentous locks, having a woolly, but not altogether a ragged
    appearance. A few feathers are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> intermixed, but only singly, and not
    in any part specially. One specimen is double, two nests having been
    constructed so close side by side, that there is but a partition wall
    between them. Many nests had eggs, but in throwing down the fronds all
    were broken but one, which I now have. It is pure white, unspotted,
    larger at one end, measuring ¹³⁄₂₀ inch by ⁹⁄₂₀. The average dimensions
    of the nests were about 5 inches high, and 3&#189; wide.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Tachornis</i> seems intermediate between <i>Cypselus</i>
    and <i>Collocalia</i>, with considerable general resemblance to the
    latter. This species is perhaps Hirundo 1, of Browne.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Mature consideration convinces me that this species is quite distinct
    from the <i>H. fulva</i> of Vieillot though closely allied to it. The
    present may be at once recognised by the conspicuous mottling of its
    shoulders and back with white and blue black, a character which, as far
    as I have examined, is invariable. The form of its nest also differs
    greatly from the bottle-like structures of the interesting bird of the
    Rocky Mountains.</p>

  <p>The Cave Swallow does not appear to be in any degree migratory in
    Jamaica, being abundantly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>common at all seasons. It delights in the
    neighbourhood of caverns and overhanging rocks, in the hollows of which
    it builds its ingenious nest. About a mile from Bluefields, the sea
    washes a precipitous rock of no great height, on the summit of which is
    an old fort, with some great guns, which tradition ascribes to the old
    Spanish settlers, but now dismantled, and within and without overrun
    with spiny pinguins and logwood bushes, and tangled with creepers. I
    have no doubt that this was the site of the Spanish town Oristana,
    some remains of the houses of which may yet be seen in the provision
    ground of a negro peasant adjoining. The foot of the cliff is girt with
    irregular masses of honey-combed rock, between which the incoming tide
    rolls, and frets, and boils, in foaming confusion; and the front is
    hollowed into caves, some of which are long passages with an opening
    at each end, and others are merely wide-mouthed, but shallow hollows.
    In one of these I counted forty nests of this species of Swallow, each
    consisting of a half cup, built with little pellets of mud, retaining,
    in so damp a situation, and where the rock itself is covered with a
    slimy mouldiness,—their original humidity. Each was thickly lined with
    silk-cotton. If we imagine a pint basin divided perpendicularly through
    the middle, and the one-half stuck against a wall, we shall perceive
    the form of these nests; some, however, were both larger and deeper
    than this. In many instances advantage was taken of a slight hollow
    in the rock, which increased the capacity. In one, (it was about the
    middle of July,) I found three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> eggs; in some others the callow young,
    and in one two full fledged birds, which lay quietly in the nest, side
    by side, while their black eyes watched my motions. The parent birds
    flew about in affright, occasionally coming close up to the nests, and
    hovering as if about to alight, but scarcely one ventured in. The eggs
    measure about ⁸⁄₁₀ inch long, and ¹¹⁄₂₀ wide; they are white, studded
    with dots and spots of dull red; but in many eggs which I have examined
    there is much variation in size, form, and colour. The young birds
    scarcely differed from the adult.</p>

  <p>In May, my kind friend Mr. Aaron Deleon, took me to a curious cavern,
    situated on the estate called Amity, some few miles from Savannah le
    Mar, but inland. Through its dark recesses a subterraneous river flows,
    so still and so perfectly transparent, that although two or three feet
    deep, I did not perceive that there was a drop of water there, but took
    the atoms floating on its surface, to be lodged in invisible spiders’
    webs, stretched across. Numerous Swallows were flying in and out, and
    the roof was studded with nests similar to those above described.</p>

  <p>Though this little Swallow manifests a decided predilection for
    cavernous recesses, it does not confine itself to situations so
    recluse. In that part of the “King’s House,” at Spanish town, which
    is called the Arcade, where clerks are writing, and public business
    is transacted every day, great numbers of these nests are affixed to
    the beams and joists, and the birds are continually flying to and fro.
    Before the year 1838, they had built in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> Secretary’s Office, from
    time immemorial; but it was not in consequence of any molestation
    there, that in the Year of Freedom, they chose the vice-regal abode.
    Did they then recognise the administrator of England’s power as the
    friend of Jamaica?</p>

  <p>In December, January, and February, the birds, though they fly in and
    out of the august abode without reserve, as if to maintain their right
    of way, do not make use of the nests; but all the rest of the year,
    these mud habitations are occupied. In March the old birds begin to
    repair and tenant their former nests; but the young, having no home
    ready made, are compelled to wait until the May rains have moistened
    the earth in the roads, to afford them mud for their structures.</p>

  <p>But as soon as these seasonal changes have taken place, these birds
    may be seen congregated on the roads, in groups of fifty together,
    huddled at the edges of the pools formed by the daily rains, and in
    those places where the power of the morning sun has already evaporated
    the water, and the mud has begun to acquire a stiffness of consistence,
    which probably is more suitable for moulding to their nests. As
    they alight to pick up the pellets, their wings are held nearly
    perpendicularly over the back, and they are incessantly fluttering
    about, apparently hindering one another by their crowding. Many may be
    seen engaged, where the pools are a little wider, or where the streams
    that cross the road dilate into a broad surface, in sweeping backward
    and forward over the water, which at every turn they just kiss with
    their beaks. I know not whether they are drinking, or capturing minute
    surface insects.</p>

    very centre of the island, as in Manchester, and St. Ann’s. It is not
    until we ascend this central chain, that we meet with this sweet bird,

  <p>As closely allied to the Purple Martin, in manners, as in form and
    colouring, I long mistook the present bird for that well-known species,
    as I think others have done also. The white belly is, however, a
    sufficient mark of distinction. It is very common, at least in the
    lowlands and inferior mountain ranges, during the summer; some remain
    with us through the winter, but as there is a very marked diminution
    of their numbers, I conclude that a large body of them migrate on the
    approach of that season, probably to Central America. About the end of
    March we see them in great numbers, assembled early in the morning on
    the topmost branches of the lofty cotton trees, which at that season
    are leafless. On these they crowd so closely, side by side, that I have
    known five to be killed at one discharge. In the autumn we observe
    exactly the same habit. Perhaps we may trace some analogy here to
    those periodical congregations of other species which are known to be
    connected with migration.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

  <p>It is a remarkable fact, that of the seven species of Swallows and
    Swifts which summer in North America, all of which are stated to
    migrate to the southward before winter, not one should have occurred to
    me in Jamaica. Although every day through the winter months, my almost
    undivided attention was given to birds; and though from August to April
    about thirteen hundred specimens of birds fell into my hands, more
    than one thousand of which were shot by myself and my servants, not a
    single individual of a North American species was observed among them.
    I simply state the fact, leaving any one to draw his own inferences.</p>

  <p>At the same time, I should observe, that Mr. Hill thinks that
    <i>Acanthylis pelasgia</i> visits Jamaica in its periodical migration.
    Referring to an incident which he had mentioned to me before, he says,
    “The migratory <i>hirundines</i>, whose squadrons moving in circles, I
    gave you a sketch of in March last, as seen by me at that time passing
    over us from south to north, (and I have observed them yearly either
    in that month or in April,) I conclude to be flocks of <i>pelasgia</i>
    on their passage to their summer homes northward, after wintering
    in the tropics. The circular movement of the migratory retinue; the
    direction of their flight; their known wintering on the neighbouring
    intertropical shores; their association at all times in multitudinous
    numbers; and the cry with which they announce their passage, as they
    leisurely course round,—<em>tsippee, tsippee, tsippee</em>,
    seem to me so many identifications of this species.”</p>

  <p>The Blue Swallow has the same propensity to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span> bring up his family in
    darkness, as his purple brother. The stipe of an old palm, whose porous
    centre decays, while the iron fibres of the exterior remain strong,
    is his ordinary resort. At the beginning of April, I observed several
    pairs flying in and out of holes, bored I suppose by the Woodpecker, in
    the stipe of a dead Cocoa-nut still tall and erect, but a mere leafless
    post, tottering in the breeze and ready to fall. At the middle of May,
    Sam observed several pairs entering a round hole, about two inches in
    diameter, beneath the eaves of Belmont house.</p>

  <p>Near the end of June, when on my way in a coasting boat from Bluefields
    to Kingston, I was lying wind-bound in Starvegut Bay. There the
    inhospitable shore is strewn with immense fragments of limestone rock,
    honey-combed and fretted into holes, through which the surf breaking
    furiously, finds vent in perpendicular jets and spouts of water, or in
    columns of spray resembling steam from an engine-pipe, accompanied with
    crashing roar. Yet I observed with interest, that the Blue Swallows
    were frequenting these rocks, and I noticed one repeatedly going in
    and out of a small hole near the summit of a rugged mass, separated
    from the shore, and completely isolated by the boiling surf. Lansdown
    Guilding, in some notes on the Zoology of the Caribbean Islands, (Zool.
    Jour. III. 408,) observes, “We have but few of this family in St.
    Vincents: among them is a Swallow, which roosts, and I believe builds,
    in the rock of the sea-shore. It is curious,” he adds, “to observe the
    bird in calm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> weather skimming patiently along the sea in search of
    insects, evidently ignorant of the fact that they are confined to fresh
    water, and do not sport on the surface of salt waters.” I cannot agree,
    however, with this accomplished naturalist here: that the Swallows do
    occasionally skim over the sea, is undeniable; and that gnats and other
    minute insects are also in the habit of frequenting the salt water,
    though not in such numbers as over the fresh ponds and rivers, is no
    less certain, at least in Jamaica.</p>

    <p>I doubt much if <i>Todus multicolor</i> of Lafresnaye, figured in
      D’Orbigny’s Birds of Cuba, is specifically different from this; the
      slight distinctions of hue being scarcely more than variations which
      I have found in Jamaican specimens; some of which, in my possession,
      display the pale blue on the sides of the throat, and the orange on the
      flanks.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In all parts of Jamaica that I have visited, the Tody is a very common
    bird. On the summit of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>Bluefields mountain, about three thousand
    feet from the level of the sea, and particularly where the deserted
    provision-grounds are overgrown with a thicket, almost impenetrable,
    of jointer, or joint-wood (<i>Piper geniculatum</i>), it is especially
    abundant. Always conspicuous from its bright grass-green coat, and
    crimson-velvet gorget, it is still a very tame bird; yet this seems
    rather the tameness of indifference than of confidence; it will allow
    a person to approach very near, and, if disturbed, alight on another
    twig a few yards distant. We have often captured specimens with the
    insect net, and struck them down with a switch, and it is not uncommon
    for the little boys to creep up behind one, and actually to clap the
    hand over it as it sits, and thus secure it. It is a general favourite,
    and has received a favourite name, that of Robin Redbreast. There is
    little resemblance, however, between the West Indian and the European
    namesakes. I have never seen the Tody on the ground; but it hops about
    the twigs of low trees, searching for minute insects, occasionally
    uttering a querulous, sibilant note. But more commonly it is seen
    sitting patiently on a twig, with the head drawn in, the beak pointing
    upwards, the loose plumage puffed out, when it appears much larger than
    it is. It certainly has an air of stupidity when thus seen. But this
    abstraction is more apparent than real; if we watch it, we shall see
    that the odd-looking grey eyes are glancing hither and thither, and
    that, ever and anon, the bird sallies out upon a short feeble flight,
    snaps at something in the air, and returns to his twig<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> to swallow it.
    It is instructive to note by how various means the wisdom of God has
    ordained a given end to be attained. The Swallow and the Tody live on
    the same prey, insects on the wing; and the short, hollow, and feeble
    wings of the latter, are as effectual to him, as the long and powerful
    pinions are to the Swallow. He has no powers to employ in pursuing
    insects, but he waits till they come within his circumscribed range,
    and no less certainly secures his meal.</p>

  <p>I have never seen the Tody eating vegetable food; but I have
    occasionally found in its stomach, among minute coleopterous and
    hymenopterous insects, a few small seeds. One, which I kept in a cage,
    would snatch worms from me with impudent audacity; and then beat them
    violently against the perch or sides of the cage to divide, before he
    swallowed, them.</p>

  <p>One, captured with a net in April, on being turned into a room, began
    immediately to catch flies, and other minute insects that flitted
    about, particularly little destructive <i>Tineadæ</i> that infested
    my dried birds. At this employment he continued incessantly, and most
    successfully, all that evening, and all the next day from earliest
    dawn to dusk. He would sit on the edge of the tables, on the lines, on
    shelves, or on the floor, ever glancing about, now and then flitting
    up into the air, when the snap of his beak announced a capture, and
    he returned to some station to eat it. He would peep into the lowest
    and darkest corners, even under the tables, for the little globose,
    long-legged spiders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> which he would drag from their webs and swallow.
    He sought these also about the ceiling and walls, and found very many.
    I have said that he continued at this employment all day without
    intermission, and, though I took no account, I judged that, on an
    average, he made a capture per minute. We may thus form some idea of
    the immense number of insects destroyed by these and similar birds;
    bearing in mind that this was in a room, where the human eye scarcely
    recognised a dozen insects altogether; and that, in the free air,
    insects would doubtless be much more numerous. Water in a basin was in
    the room, but I did not see him drink, though occasionally he perched
    on the brim; and when I inserted his beak into the water, he would
    not drink. Though so actively engaged in his own occupation, he cared
    nothing for the presence of man; he sometimes alighted voluntarily on
    our heads, shoulders, or fingers; and when sitting, would permit me
    at any time to put my hand over him and take him up; though, when in
    the hand, he would struggle to get out. He seemed likely to thrive,
    but incautiously settling in front of a dove-cage, a surly Baldpate
    poked his head through the wires, and with his beak aimed a cruel blow
    at the pretty green head of the unoffending and unsuspecting Tody. He
    appeared not to mind it at first, but did not again fly; and about an
    hour afterward, on my taking him into my hand, and throwing him up, he
    could only flutter to the ground, and on laying him on the table, he
    stretched out his little feet, shivered, and died.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

  <p>The inhabitants of Jamaica are not in the habit of domesticating many
    of the native birds; else this is one of the species which would become
    a favourite pet. In a state of liberty, however, it attracts the
    admiration, even of the most unobservant, and an European is charmed
    with it. As it sits on a twig in the verdure of spring, its grass-green
    coat is sometimes undistinguishable from the leaves in which it is
    embowered, itself looking like a leaf; but a little change of position
    bringing its throat into the sun’s rays, the light suddenly gleams as
    from a glowing coal. Occasionally, too, this crimson plumage is puffed
    out into a globose form, when its appearance is particularly beautiful.</p>

  <p>The tongue is fleshy for but a small part of its length, the remainder
    consisting of a flat, or slightly concave, transparent, horny lamina;
    just like a cut from the side of a quill; it is seen, under a lens, to
    be snipped at the edges, into very minute and close-set barbs pointing
    backwards. The skin is exceedingly thin, and so tender, as to render it
    a very difficult task to prepare a specimen.</p>

  <p>The Tody, as has been long known, builds in holes in the earth, in the
    manner of the Kingfisher. Near Scott’s Cove, I was shown, by the side
    of the deep road, holes in the clay, which were said to be the nesting
    holes of the “Robin.” And near Spanish Town, a friend pointed out a
    hole in a bank in his own garden, in which a Tody was then building, in
    March. But, as I have never seen the nest or eggs, I am indebted to the
    notes of Mr. Hill for a detailed description.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

  <p>“The Green Tody is a bird of peculiar structure, and peculiar habits.
    It is exclusively an insect feeder, and burrows in the earth to breed.
    The banks of ravines, and the scarps of dry ditches, are excavated by
    its feeble feet, in which two out of three of its front toes are united
    together, leaving only the terminal joint free, and hence the feet
    of this kind of birds are called <i>syndactylous</i>. The hole runs
    into the banks some eight inches or a foot: at the extremity of this
    subterranean lodging, it nestles in secrecy and security.</p>

  <p>“As the subterranean nest is made wherever there is friable mould easy
    of excavation,—ravines and gullies, whose banks are earthy, and where
    the water passes off rapidly from the surface-soil, are generally
    selected for breeding. These gullies are sheltered from exposure to
    the drift rain by opposing banks, or they are covered by over-hanging
    shrubs. The excavation is made by means of the beak and claws. It
    is a winding gallery, rounded at the bottom, and terminating in a
    sufficiently wide lodging, lined with pliant fibres, and dry moss and
    cotton, placed with some attention to arrangement. Four or five grey,
    brown-spotted eggs are laid, and the young are fed within the cave till
    they are full-fledged.</p>

  <p>“The combination of circumstances that make up a fit nestling place for
    it, may be well understood from the following selection of a burrow,
    by a pair of birds, in the garden of a friend. A box filled with earth
    had been placed on tressels within water, for growing lettuces from
    seed, or rather for saving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> the seed, whilst vegetating, from the
    depredations of ants. The box had performed its office;—the lettuces
    had been transplanted, and the mould remained in undisturbed fallow.
    The box having a knot-hole in the side, through this hole a pair of
    Todies burrowed a gallery into the heart of the mould, built a nest,
    and reared a family of young ones. They were assiduous sitters, the
    male and female relieving each other. Though they attracted a good deal
    of attention, and were not unfrequently disturbed by the curiosity of
    visitors, they steadfastly pursued their family affairs, and showed
    surprising vigilance and caution in escaping out of their cavern, when
    they were either watched, or attempts were made to catch them. They
    never failed to profit by the moment when attention was withdrawn from
    them, either to come from out of their cave, or to dart into it. On
    opening the earth after the young had fled, there was found a capacious
    winding gallery into the centre of the box, ending in a circular
    lodging, in which was contained the nest, composed of fibrous roots and
    cotton.</p>

  <p>“There is such an obvious similarity between the Kingfisher and the
    Tody, particularly the brilliant blue and green European Kingfisher,
    that few who are acquainted with both fail to recognise their affinity.
    The brilliant plumage of the two birds; the patient watchfulness with
    which they both sit on some exposed twig to await the vagrant prey;
    their short flight from station to station; and their repeated return
    to the same spot;—independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> of that intimate resemblance in the
    structure of their extremities, which led Brisson, Latreille, and
    Cuvier, to arrange the Halcyons in company with the Todies, would
    induce one to conclude that there was some propinquity in their
    natures, without any great knowledge of Natural History. The difference
    of the element in which they severally seek their food, does not
    widen the affinity between them, for the Jacamars of America, and the
    Martin-chasseurs of Africa, or King-hunters, as they are called, to
    distinguish them, in their pursuit of a terrestrial or aërial prey,
    from the Kingfishers or Martin-pecheurs, which seek theirs only in
    the water,—are placed in no less near a relationship of habits and
    structure. The similarity is remarkably increased, when we go on to the
    habit of burrowing, which prevails alike among all these birds, and to
    the syndactyle form of the feet. These resemblances remove all doubt
    about their classification.</p>

  <p>“The Spaniards of Hispaniola call the Green Tody by a very appropriate
    name, the Barrancali, from the barrancas or earthy ravine-cliffs in
    which it builds; <i>barranca</i> being the appellation for the deep
    breaks and gullies made by the mountain-floods.”</p>

  <p>A nest is in my possession, attributed to the Tody, which, if rightly
    appropriated, is a remarkable deviation from a general habit. A person
    of intelligence informed me, about the middle of May, that he knew of
    a “Red-breast” building in a tree; at which he was surprised, knowing
    its habit of burrowing to breed. I assured him that he must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span> be in
    error; but he was confident of the fact, however anomalous, as he had
    seen the bird actually in the nest. In a few days he sent me the twig
    with the nest upon it. It was certainly one to which I could assign no
    probable ownership, but that he had mentioned. It was built on a small
    shrubby tree, in the fork formed by one of the principal branches, and
    a twig that it sent forth, being rather wider than a right angle. As
    the main branch is not thicker than one’s little finger, and the nest
    is stretched from the one to the other, the outline of the rim forms
    a long oval about 1&#189; inch by &#190;; and &#190; inch deep. It is a thin,
    very frail structure, formed of spiders’ webs stretched along, in which
    are profusely inlaid the shining, brown perules of some leaf-buds;
    with the addition of a little silk-cotton, this is the whole: it
    looks unfinished. To set against the improbability of this being the
    nest of a Tody, there are these two considerations:—First, the direct
    evidence of an intelligent and observant man, who, I feel sure, would
    not willingly deceive me, and to whom the Tody was too familiar for him
    to mistake its identity. Secondly, the nest is too small for any other
    known Jamaican bird, except the Humming-birds; and I have specimens
    of the nests of all our known species, not one of which it resembles
    at all. I have no doubt that the report is correct, and that it is an
    aberration of habit.</p>

  <p>On my arrival in Jamaica in December, I used frequently to see this
    well-known bird sitting on the bushes that overhang the romantic river
    of Bluefields, or shooting along on swift wing, over its rapid course.
    As the spring came on, however, and merged into summer, I ceased to see
    it, there or elsewhere, no doubt because it had migrated to the north;
    the very individuals that I had seen in Jamaica being, perhaps, now
    in Canada. About the beginning of September it again appeared, rather
    numerously for a solitary bird, scarcely a morning passing without
    our seeing one or more along the sea-side. Where the mangrove or the
    sea-grape stretches its branches down to the water’s edge, stopping the
    way along the yellow beach, the Kingfisher delights to resort, sitting
    on a projecting twig; here he waits patiently for the approach of some
    small fish, on which he drops perpendicularly, and having seized it in
    his powerful beak, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>emerges from the wave, and returns to his former
    station to swallow it. It is a very shy and recluse bird; I have found
    scarcely any more difficult of approach: the posts of observation which
    he chooses are mostly such as command a wide view; and it is very wary;
    long before the gunner can creep within shot, the bird takes alarm, and
    darts away to a distant tree. Often as it sits watching, and sometimes
    at the moment of flying, it utters a loud rattling <em>churr</em>.</p>

  <p>Though in general a solitary bird, it is not unusual to observe two
    playing together, chasing each other from tree to tree. A pair which
    I obtained soon after their autumnal appearance, were thus engaged.
    I watched them a long while, endeavouring to get a shot at them, but
    owing to their wariness, was long unsuccessful. They took a wide round,
    including, as alighting places, three high cotton-trees, one or two
    mangroves, and a sea-grape, returning to these in succession, though
    not with perfect regularity. As they flew they called to each other,
    with the usual harsh cry; now and then they paused to mark the shoals
    of small fishes that were swimming beneath, and plunged down upon them;
    and I noticed that at such times the bird went wholly under water. Once
    both birds seized the same fish, nearly at the same moment, and rising
    with it into the air, each tugged in contrary directions, until the
    grasp of one gave way. At last my assistant, Sam, taking advantage of
    a dense and matted withe near one of the alighting trees, concealed
    himself in it, whence he shot them both.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> The first was only wounded,
    and falling into the water swam out sea-ward, <em>striking out</em>
    boldly, the wings, however, partially opened. On being seized he proved
    very fierce, erecting the long crest, and endeavouring to strike with
    his pointed beak. He got hold of my thumb, and squeezed so powerfully,
    that the cutting edge of the upper mandible sliced a piece of flesh
    clean out. He was tenacious of life, for though I pressed the trachea
    until motion ceased, he repeatedly revived.</p>

  <p>The form of the body of this bird, in conjunction with the head and
    beak, is wedge-shaped, the tip of the latter being the point. This
    form is admirably suited for its sudden and impetuous plunges upon
    its fishy prey; as the powerful texture, great size, sharp point, and
    cutting edges of the beak, are for holding it. The feathers of the
    throat and breast are of the closest texture, and lie on each other
    like scales, preventing the access of any water to the body, while,
    from their glossy, satiny surface, the water is thrown off instantly on
    emersion, as from the plumage of a duck. The feet again, though small,
    are muscular, the tarsus very short, the toes united into a broad,
    flat palm, and the claws unusually strong, short, and sharp. When one
    remembers that the Kingfisher digs his own cave out of the clayey or
    gravelly cliffs to the depth of several feet, we shall see the use of
    his strong and broad feet, as we may see it also in the Mole. Beautiful
    proofs of our God’s consummate wisdom in forming his creatures!</p>

  <p>Scarcely larger than the average size of the Humming-birds, this
    little Creeper is often seen in company with them, probing the same
    flowers, and for the same purpose, but in a very different manner.
    Instead of hovering in front of each blossom, a task to which his short
    wings would be utterly incompetent, the Quit alights on the tree, and
    proceeds, in the most business-like manner, to peep into the flowers,
    hopping actively from twig <span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>to twig, and throwing the body into all
    positions, often clinging by the feet with the back downwards, the
    better to reach the interior of a blossom, with his curved beak, and
    pencilled tongue. The minute insects which are always found in the
    interior of flowers, are the object of his search, and the reward of
    his perseverance. Unsuspectingly familiar, these birds often resort
    to the blossoming shrubs of gardens and yards. A large Moringa tree,
    that is all through the year profusely set with fragrant spikes of
    bloom, is a favourite resort both of these and the Humming-birds. One
    within a few feet of my window, is, while I write this note, being
    carefully scrutinised by two active little creatures, that pursue their
    examination with a zeal perfectly undisturbed by my looking on, while
    the same blossoms are rifled on one side by a minute Humming-bird, and
    on the other by that gorgeous butterfly <i>Urania Sloaneus</i>: an
    interesting association! The Quit often utters a soft, sibilant note,
    as it peeps about.</p>

  <p>The nest of this bird is very frequently, perhaps usually, built in
    those low trees and bushes, from whose twigs depend the paper nests of
    the Brown Wasps, and in close contiguity with them. The Grass Quits
    are said to manifest the same predilection: it is a singular exercise
    of instinct, almost of reason; for the object is doubtless the defence
    afforded by the presence of the formidable insects; but upon what terms
    the league of amity is contracted between the neighbours, I am ignorant.</p>

  <p>It is in the months of May, June, and July, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> this Creeper performs
    the business of incubation. On the 4th of May, as I was riding to
    Savanna le Mar, I observed a Banana Quit with a bit of silk-cotton in
    her beak; and on searching, found a nest just commenced in a sage-bush
    (<i>Lantana camara</i>). The structure, though but a skeleton, was
    evidently about to be a dome, and <em>so far</em>, was constructed of
    silk-cotton. Since then I have seen several completed nests. One now
    before me, is in the form of a globe, with a small opening below the
    side. The walls are very thick, composed of dry grass, intermixed
    irregularly with the down of <i>Asclepias</i>. It appeared to have
    been forsaken, from my having paid it too much attention. It was fixed
    between the twigs of a branch of a <i>Bauhinia</i>, that projected over
    the high road, near Content, in St. Elizabeths. Another which I found
    at the end of June, in a sage-bush, was of the same structure; in this
    were two eggs, greenish-white, thickly but indefinitely dashed with
    reddish, at the larger end. Robinson states the dimensions thus:—“the
    length about 3&#189; eighths, the diameter about 2&#189; eighths,” but I
    find my specimens much larger than this: accurate measurement giving
    ⁵⁄₈ inch by rather less than &#189; inch.</p>

  <p>An exceedingly interesting memoir, from the pen of Mr. Hill, on the
    prevalence of domed nests within the tropics, and the connexion of this
    fact with electricity, will be found in the Zoological Transactions for
    September 14th, 1841.</p>

  <p>It is with hesitation that I place this species in the genus Certhiola.
    The extreme slenderness of the beak, its curved form, and acute tip,
    the form of the wings, the length of the tarsi, and above all, <em>the
    pencil of hairs</em> which forms the termination of the tongue, have
    guided me in this decision. It appears to be so rare in the United
    States, that but a single specimen occurred to the indefatigable
    Wilson, and but one to the Prince of Canino. I found it rather less
    scarce in Jamaica, having obtained some four or five specimens in
    the course of the autumn and winter. The character of its plumage
    is certainly that of the Warblers, as is its seasonal change: of
    its manners I regret that I have no notes. When it arrives with us
    in October, the crown of the male, instead of being deep black, is
    ashy-grey, tinged here and there with yellow, and studded with black
    spots, the feathers having black disks with ashy borders. In February,
    by the growth of the feathers, and the wearing off of the edges, the
    black spots have become confluent, forming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> an unbroken black surface,
    which is its summer character. The fat of this species is of a deep
    fulvous hue, almost orange.</p>

  <p>For what reason Linnæus applied the trivial name of Mango to this
    Humming-bird I have no knowledge; that it could have no connexion with
    the mango tree is evident, since that tree was not introduced into the
    western world till long after his time. It was perhaps a native name.
    It is not confined to Jamaica, but seems more widely spread than most
    of these tiny birds. Lesson says, “The Mango inhabits Jamaica, and, as
    it appears, not only the greater Antilles, but also Terra Firma, and
    even, it is said, Brazil and Guiana.” Hence it has long been familiar
    to naturalists. It is the Largest or Blackest Humming-bird of Sloane.
    Lesson, in “Les Colibris,” has given no less than four figures of this
    species in different ages, pl. xiii. to xv., but I cannot say much in
    their praise.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Polythmus Mexicanus</i> and <i>Polythmus Jamaicensis</i> of
    Brisson, both refer, without doubt, to the present bird. It is <i lang="fr">le
    plastron noir</i> of Buffon. Whether <i>Trochilus gramineus</i> of St.
    Domingo, which has been supposed to represent this species in that
    sister island, is really any thing more than a variety, I have no means
    of determining. My valued friend Mr. Hill, in writing to me observes,
    “Buffon makes his ‘<i lang="fr">plastron noir</i>’ of Jamaica, common to Brazil
    and St. Domingo. The compensatory bird in St. Domingo is much more
    green than Jamaica specimens; i. e., with a less disposition to assume
    the violet and purple in the changes of light, and with decidedly a
    less prevalence of what Buffon designates the ‘beau noir velouté.’”</p>

  <p>I may add that both the birds alluded to have been familiar to my
    friend, from personal observation in both islands.</p>

  <p>The appellation by which the Mango Humming-bird is familiarly known to
    the negroes in the colony, is that of “Doctor bird,” which, however,
    is sometimes applied also to Polytmus. It is thus explained by Mr.
    Hill:—“In the old time, when costume was more observed than now,—the
    black livery among the gayer and more brilliant Trochilidæ represented
    the Doctor. It might with equal propriety have been the parson; but
    parsons were less known than doctors, in the old times of the colony.”</p>

  <p>Though occurring at all seasons, I have not found the Mango abundant
    at any; it is, indeed, far less common than either <i>Polytmus</i>
    or <i>Humilis</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> It affects the lowlands in preference to the
    mountains, and open places rather than the deep woods; yet it is rarely
    seen to suck the blossoms of herbs or shrubs, as Humilis does, but
    like Polytmus hovers around blossoming trees. The bunch of blossom at
    the summit of the pole-like papaw-tree (<i>Carica papaya</i>) is a
    favourite resort of this species, particularly at sunset. This habit I
    observed and took advantage of very soon after my arrival, for there
    was a fine male papaw tree in profuse bloom close to the door at
    Bluefields, which the Mango frequented. Wishing to keep these birds in
    captivity, I watched at the tree one evening with a gauze ring-net in
    my hand, with which I dashed at one, and though I missed my aim, the
    attempt so astonished it, that it appeared to have lost its presence of
    mind, so to speak, flitting hurriedly hither and thither for several
    seconds before it flew away. The next evening, however, I was more
    successful. I took my station, and remained quite still, the net being
    held up close to an inviting bunch of blossom: the Humming-birds came
    near in their course round the tree, sipped the surrounding blossoms,
    eyeing the net; hung in the air for a moment in front of the fatal
    cluster without touching it, and then, arrow-like, darted away. At
    length one, after surveying the net, passed again round the tree; on
    approaching it the second time, perceiving the strange object to be
    still unmoved, he took courage, and began to suck. I quite trembled
    with hope: in an instant the net was struck, and before I could see
    anything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> the rustling of his confined wings within the gauze told
    that the little beauty was a captive. I brought him in triumph to the
    house and caged him; but he was very restless, clinging to the sides
    and wires, and fluttering violently about. The next morning, having
    gone out on an excursion for a few hours, I found the poor bird on my
    return, dying, having beaten himself to death. I never again took this
    species alive.</p>

  <p>The sustenance of the Humming-birds is, I feel assured, derived
    almost exclusively from insects. That they seek the nectar of flowers
    I readily admit, and that they will eagerly take dissolved sugar or
    diluted honey in captivity I also know; but that this would maintain
    life, or at least vigour, I have great reasons for doubting, which I
    shall mention in the history of the following species. I have dissected
    numbers of each of our species, and have invariably found the little
    stomach distended with a soft black substance, exactly like what we
    see in the stomachs of the Warblers, which being put into clear water,
    and examined with a lens, proves to be entirely composed of minute
    insects. The interior of flowers is almost always inhabited by very
    small insects, and it is I believe principally to pick out these that
    the Humming-birds probe the tubular nectaries of blossoms. Wilson has
    mentioned his having observed the Ruby-throat (<i>T. Colubris</i>)
    pursuing flies on the wing. I also have witnessed the same thing in our
    species, many times. I have seen the Mango, just before night fall,
    fluttering round the top of a tree on which were no blossoms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> and from
    the manner in which it turned hither and thither, while hovering in a
    perpendicular position, it was manifest that it was catching minute
    insects. This species when flying often flirts and flutters the tail in
    a peculiar manner, throwing it in as he hangs perpendicularly in mid
    air, when the appearance of the broad lustrous feathers, expanded like
    a fan, is particularly beautiful.</p>

  <p>The pugnacity of the Humming-birds has been often spoken of; two of
    the same species can rarely suck flowers from the same bush without
    a rencontre. Mango, however, will even drive away another species,
    which I have never observed the others to do. I once witnessed a
    combat between two of the present species, which was prosecuted with
    much pertinacity, and protracted to an unusual length. It was in the
    month of April, when I was spending a few days at Phœnix Park, near
    Savanna le Mar, the residence of my kind friend, Aaron Deleon, Esq.
    In the garden were two trees, of the kind called the Malay apple
    (<i>Eugenia Malaccensis</i>), one of which was but a yard or two
    from my window. The genial influence of the spring rains had covered
    them with a profusion of beautiful blossoms, each consisting of a
    multitude of crimson stamens, with very minute petals; like bunches of
    crimson tassels; but the leaf-buds were but just beginning to open. A
    Mango Humming-bird had, every day, and all day long, been paying his
    devoirs to these charming blossoms. On the morning to which I allude,
    another came, and the manœuvres of these two tiny creatures became
    highly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> interesting. They chased each other through the labyrinth of
    twigs and flowers, till, an opportunity occurring, the one would dart
    with seeming fury upon the other, and then, with a loud rustling of
    their wings, they would twirl together, round and round, until they
    nearly came to the earth. It was some time before I could see, with
    any distinctness, what took place in these tussles; their twirlings
    were so rapid as to baffle all attempts at discrimination. At length
    an encounter took place pretty close to me, and I perceived that the
    beak of the one grasped the beak of the other, and thus fastened, both
    whirled round and round in their perpendicular descent, the point of
    contact being the centre of the gyrations, till, when another second
    would have brought them both on the ground, they separated, and the
    one chased the other for about a hundred yards, and then returned
    in triumph to the tree, where, perched on a lofty twig, he chirped
    monotonously and pertinaciously for some time;—I could not help
    thinking, in defiance. In a few minutes, however, the banished one
    returned, and began chirping no less provokingly, which soon brought
    on another chase, and another tussle. I am persuaded that these were
    hostile encounters, for one seemed evidently afraid of the other,
    fleeing when the other pursued, though his indomitable spirit would
    prompt the chirp of defiance; and, when resting after a battle, I
    noticed that this one held his beak open, as if panting. Sometimes
    they would suspend hostilities to suck a few blossoms, but mutual
    proximity was sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> to bring them on again, with the same result. In
    their tortuous and rapid evolutions, the light from their ruby necks
    would now and then flash in the sun with gem-like radiance; and as
    they now and then hovered motionless, the broadly expanded tail,—whose
    outer feathers are crimson-purple, but when intercepting the sun’s rays
    transmit orange-coloured light,—added much to their beauty. A little
    Banana Quit, that was peeping among the blossoms in his own quiet way,
    seemed now and then to look with surprise on the combatants; but when
    the one had driven his rival to a longer distance than usual, the
    victor set upon the unoffending Quit, who soon yielded the point, and
    retired, humbly enough, to a neighbouring tree. The war, for it was a
    thorough campaign, a regular succession of battles, lasted fully an
    hour, and then I was called away from the post of observation. Both of
    the Humming-birds appeared to be adult males. I have alluded to the
    preference which different species appear to manifest, for different
    blossoms; I may add that I have observed <i>Mellisuga humilis</i> come
    and suck the flowers of a Cashew tree (<i>Anacardium</i>), without
    noticing those of the Malay apple close by, while Mango seems to
    despise the former for the latter.</p>

  <p>The lustrous glow reflected from the sides of the neck of the
    adult male, may be unperceived on a careless examination. In such
    Humming-birds as I have examined, (perhaps in all,) the iridescence of
    those portions of the plumage that are changeable, is splendid in the
    ratio of the acuteness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> the angle formed by the incident ray and the
    reflected one. Thus the plumes of the neck of Mango appear to advantage
    in a room with a single light, only when the beholder stands with his
    back to the window, and has the bird before him and facing him. Then
    the perpendicular band down the throat and breast, which seems composed
    of the richest black velvet, is bounded on each side by a broad band of
    glowing crimson, mingled with violet. It must be borne in mind, that
    <em>some</em> of the brilliant hues of Humming-birds are permanent, not
    changeable colours.</p>

  <p>I have never met with the nest of this species; but Sam informed me in
    June that he had observed one near Morgan’s Bridge, in Westmoreland. It
    was on a dead tree, and was placed <em>upon</em> a twig, but being full
    fifteen feet from the ground he could not examine it. He, however, saw
    the Mango Humming-bird fly out of it, and presently return. A nest,
    presented to me by my friend Mr. Hill, ticketed as that of Mango,
    is now before me. It has evidently been constructed to stand upon a
    horizontal twig, which the bottom has embraced. It is cylindrical
    externally, the bottom being nearly flat. Its height is 1&#189; inch; its
    external diameter a little more; its internal diameter about 1 inch;
    the hollow, which is a little overhung by the margin, is cup-shaped,
    about ⁷⁄₈ inch deep. It is composed almost entirely of the down of the
    gigantic silk-cotton tree, (<i>Eriodendron anfractuosum</i>) intermixed
    at the bottom with a little true cotton. The sides are tightly banded
    round with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> the threads of spiders’ webs, very neatly put on, and the
    whole exterior is studded with a minute whitish lichen, so profusely
    as almost entirely to conceal the down, without at all injuring the
    symmetry of the form. It is a most compact and beautiful little
    structure.</p>

  <p>The down of the cotton-tree is the material ordinarily chosen by
    all our Humming-birds for the construction of their nests. The tree
    attains a giant size and diameter, and throws out to a vast distance
    its horizontal limbs, each equalling in its dimensions an ordinary
    forest tree. It is one of the few in those tropical islands, which are
    deciduous: the fierce blasts called “norths,” which prevail in January
    and February, pouring down from the mountains, quickly lay it bare.
    I have seen an enormous tree in full foliage, almost leafless in an
    hour; the leaves filling the air, like flakes of snow in a driving
    storm. While it is yet denuded, the pods appear at the ends of the
    branches, resembling green walnuts: these ripen before the leaves bud,
    and opening, give freedom to a mass of fine silky filamentous down,
    which is borne away upon the wind. The filaments are so fine, that at
    this season, April and May, they are imbibed with the air we breathe,
    being almost impalpable, and are considered to aggravate pulmonary
    affections. The tufts so scattered, the Humming-birds and others of the
    feathered tribes, diligently collect, and that not only on the ground.
    I have been amused to observe a Mango Humming-bird suspending himself
    in the air, over against a puff of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> down, which was slowly borne along
    upon a gentle breeze, picking at it and drawing filaments from it,
    doubtless with a view to nest-building.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This is the gem of Jamaican Ornithology. Its slender form, velvet
    crest, emerald bosom, and lengthened tail-plumes, render it one of the
    most elegant even of this most brilliant family. Though peculiar, as
    far as I am aware, to Jamaica, it has long been known, though it would
    seem from received <span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>figures and descriptions very imperfectly. Edwards
    long ago gave a figure of it, which is recognisable. Lesson’s figure
    and description are alike bad. The attitude is that never assumed by
    a Humming-bird; the back of the neck is made green instead of black;
    the scaly emerald plumage is diminished to a mere gorget instead of
    extending over the whole breast and belly; the beak and feet are both
    made yellow, whereas the former should have been crimson, the latter
    purple-black. He makes “Les Polythmus” his tenth Race, which he thus
    defines: “Beak short, straight: the external tail-feathers terminated
    by two long blades or filaments (<em>brins</em>).” Here every character
    is incorrect. The beak, though not long, is certainly not short; it is
    not straight, but perceptibly curved, particularly in the female; the
    curvature, it is true, varies in individuals, but I possess several
    females whose beaks are more curved than that of Mango; it is not the
    external tail-feather that is lengthened, but the second from the
    outside; lastly, this feather is not terminated by a filament, or by
    any structure varying from the other part; it is simply produced in
    length.</p>

  <p>Mr. Swainson writes as if he were unacquainted with this species, for
    in speaking of the tendency of the lengthened external feathers of
    the tail in certain families of birds to turn <em>outwards</em> towards
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>their tips, he observes, “there is one solitary instance where these
    long exterior feathers are turned <em>inwards</em> instead of outwards:
    this occurs in a Humming-bird figured by Edwards, as a native of
    Jamaica, <em>but we have never yet</em> seen it, nor is a specimen known
    to exist at this time in any museum.” (Class. Birds, I. 105.) This is
    no other than Polytmus; the long tail-feathers of which do bend inwards
    so as to cross each other when the bird is resting. I may add here that
    these long feathers have the inner edge prettily waved, not by actual
    indentation, but by a puckering of the margin, like a frill.
  </p>

  <p>The Long-tail is a permanent resident in Jamaica, and is not uncommonly
    seen at all seasons and in all situations. It loves to frequent the
    margins of woods and road-sides, where it sucks the blossoms of the
    trees, occasionally descending, however, to the low shrubs. There
    is one locality where it is abundant, the summit of that range of
    mountains just behind Bluefields, and known as the Bluefields ridge.
    Behind the peaks which are visible from the sea, at an elevation of
    about half a mile, there runs through the dense woods a narrow path,
    just passable for a horse, overrun with beautiful ferns of many
    graceful forms, and always damp and cool. No habitation occurs within
    several miles and no cultivation, save the isolated provision grounds
    of the negroes, which are teeming with enormous Arums: and these are
    hidden from view far up in the thick woods.</p>

  <p>The refreshing coolness of this road, its unbroken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> solitude, combined
    with the peculiarity and luxuriance of the vegetation, made it one of
    my favorite resorts. Not a tree, from the thickness of one’s wrist
    up to the giant magnitude of the hoary figs and cotton trees, but
    is clothed with fantastic parasites: begonias with waxen flowers,
    and ferns with hirsute stems climb up the trunks; enormous bromelias
    spring from the greater forks, and fringe the horizontal limbs; various
    orchideæ with matted roots and grotesque blossoms droop from every
    bough, and long lianes, like the cordage of a ship, depend from the
    loftiest branches, or stretch from tree to tree. Elegant tree-ferns,
    and towering palms are numerous; here and there the wild plantain or
    heliconia waves its long flag-like leaves from amidst the humbler
    bushes, and in the most obscure corners over some decaying log, nods
    the noble spike of a magnificent limodorum. Nothing is flaunting or
    showy; all is solemn and subdued; but all is exquisitely beautiful.
    Now and then the ear is startled by the long-drawn measured notes,
    most richly sweet, of the Solitaire, itself mysteriously unseen, like
    the hymn of praise of an angel. It is so in keeping with the solitude,
    and with the scene, that we are unconsciously arrested to admire and
    listen. The smaller wood consists largely of the plant called Glass-eye
    berry, a Scrophularious shrub, the blossoms of which, though presenting
    little beauty in form or hue, are pre-eminently attractive to the
    Long-tailed Humming-bird. These bushes are at no part of the year out
    of blossom, the scarlet berries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> appearing at all seasons on the same
    stalk as the flowers. And here at any time one may with tolerable
    certainty calculate on finding these very lovely birds. But it is in
    March, April, and May, that they abound: I suppose I have sometimes
    seen not fewer than a hundred come successively to rifle the blossoms
    within the space of half as many yards in the course of a forenoon.
    They are, however, in no respect gregarious; though three or four may
    be at one moment hovering round the blossoms of the same bush, there
    is no association; each is governed by his individual preference, and
    each attends to his own affairs. It is worthy of remark that males
    compose by far the greater portion of the individuals observed at
    this elevation. I do not know why it should be so, but we see very
    few females there, whereas in the lowlands this sex outnumbers the
    other. In March, a large number are found to be clad in the livery
    of the adult male, but without long tail-feathers; others have the
    characteristic feathers lengthened, but in various degrees. These are,
    I have no doubt, males of the preceding season. It is also quite common
    to find one of the long feathers much shorter than the other; which I
    account for by concluding that the shorter is replacing one that had
    been accidentally lost. In their aerial encounters with each other, a
    tail-feather is sometimes displaced. One day several of these “young
    bloods” being together, a regular tumult ensued, somewhat similar to a
    <em>sparrow-fight</em>:—such twittering, and fluttering, and dartings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
    hither and thither! I could not exactly make out the matter, but
    suspected that it was mainly an attack, (surely a most ungallant one,
    if so) made by these upon two females of the same species, that were
    sucking at the same bush. These were certainly in the skirmish, but the
    evolutions were too rapid to be certain how the battle went.</p>

  <p>The whirring made by the vibrating wings of the male Polytmus is a
    shriller sound than that produced by the female, and indicates its
    proximity before the eye has detected it. The male almost constantly
    utters a monotonous quick chirp, both while resting on a twig, and
    while sucking from flower to flower. They do not invariably probe
    flowers upon the wing; one may frequently observe them thus engaged,
    when alighted and sitting with closed wings, and often they partially
    sustain themselves by clinging with the feet to a leaf while sucking,
    the wings being expanded, and vibrating.</p>

  <p>The Humming-birds in Jamaica do not confine themselves to any
    particular season for nidification. In almost every month of the year
    I have either found, or have had brought to me, the nests of Polytmus
    in occupation. Still as far as my experience goes, they are most
    numerous in June; while Mr. Hill considers January as the most normal
    period. It is not improbable that two broods are reared in a season.
    In the latter part of February, a friend showed me a nest of this
    species in a singular situation, but which I afterwards found to be
    quite in accordance with its usual habits. It was at Bognie, situated
    on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span> the Bluefields mountain, but at some distance from the scene above
    described. About a quarter of a mile within the woods, a blind path,
    choked up with bushes, descends suddenly beneath an overhanging rock of
    limestone, the face of which presents large projections, and hanging
    points, encrusted with a rough, tuberculous sort of stalactite. At one
    corner of the bottom there is a cavern, in which a tub is fixed to
    receive water of great purity, which perpetually drips from the roof,
    and which in the dry season is a most valuable resource. Beyond this,
    which is very obscure, the eye penetrates to a larger area, deeper
    still, which receives light from some other communication with the air.
    Round the projections and groins of the front, the roots of the trees
    above have entwined, and to a fibre of one of these hanging down, not
    thicker than whipcord, was suspended a Humming-bird’s nest, containing
    two eggs. It seemed to be composed wholly of moss, was thick, and
    attached to the rootlet by its side. One of the eggs was broken. I
    did not disturb it, but after about three weeks, visited it again. It
    had been apparently handled by some curious child, for both eggs were
    broken, and the nest was evidently deserted.</p>

  <p>But while I lingered in the romantic place, picking up some of the
    landshells which were scattered among the rocks, suddenly I heard
    the whirr of a Humming-bird, and, looking up, saw a female Polytmus
    hovering opposite the nest, with a mass of silk-cotton in her beak.
    Deterred by the sight of me, she presently retired to a twig, a few
    paces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> distant, on which she sat. I immediately sunk down among the
    rocks as quietly as possible, and remained perfectly still. In a few
    seconds she came again, and after hovering a moment disappeared behind
    one of the projections, whence in a few seconds she emerged again and
    flew off. I then examined the place, and found to my delight, a new
    nest, in all respects like the old one, but unfinished, affixed to
    another twig not a yard from it. I again sat down among the stones in
    front, where I could see the nest, not concealing myself, but remaining
    motionless, waiting for the petite bird’s reappearance. I had not to
    wait long: a loud <em>whirr</em>, and there she was, suspended in the
    air before her nest: she soon espied me, and came within a foot of my
    eyes, hovering just in front of my face. I remained still, however,
    when I heard the whirring of another just above me, perhaps the mate,
    but I durst not look towards him lest the turning of my head should
    frighten the female. In a minute or two the other was gone, and she
    alighted again on the twig, where she sat some little time preening her
    feathers, and apparently clearing her mouth from the cotton-fibres,
    for she now and then swiftly projected the tongue an inch and a half
    from the beak, continuing the same curve as that of the beak. When she
    arose, it was to perform a very interesting action; for she flew to the
    face of the rock, which was thickly clothed with soft dry moss, and
    hovering on the wing, as if before a flower, began to pluck the moss,
    until she had a large bunch of it in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> beak; then I saw her fly to
    the nest, and <em>having seated herself in it</em>, proceed to place the
    new material, pressing, and arranging, and interweaving the whole with
    her beak, while she fashioned the cup-like form of the interior, by the
    pressure of her white breast, moving round and round as she sat. My
    presence appeared to be no hindrance to her proceedings, though only
    a few feet distant; at length she left again, and I left the place
    also. On the 8th of April I visited the cave again, and found the nest
    perfected, and containing two eggs, which were not hatched on the 1st
    of May, on which day I sent Sam to endeavour to secure both dam and
    nest. He found her sitting, and had no difficulty in capturing her,
    which, with the nest and its contents, he carefully brought down to me.
    I transferred it, having broken one egg by accident, to a cage, and put
    in the bird; she was mopish, however, and quite neglected the nest, as
    she did also some flowers which I inserted; sitting moodily on a perch.
    The next morning she was dead.</p>

  <p>On the 7th of May, a lad showed me another nest of the same species,
    containing two young newly hatched. It was stuck on a twig of a seaside
    grape tree, (<i>Coccoloba</i>), about fifteen feet above the ground,
    almost above the sea, for the tree grew at the very edge of the shore,
    and the branches really did stretch over the sea. The bird was wary,
    and would not return to the nest while I staid there, or Sam, whom
    I stationed in the tree to catch her; but on our receding a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
    minutes, we found her on the nest. Sam watched sometime vainly with the
    insect-net; but as I thought, if I could secure her in a cage with her
    nest, the claims of her young would probably awaken her attention more
    than the mere unhatched eggs had done the former one, we proceeded to
    the tree at night with a lantern. The noise and shaking of the tree,
    however, had again alarmed her, (at least so we concluded,) for she
    was not on the nest when reached. The next morning Sam had occasion
    to pass twice by the grape-tree, but at neither time was the bird on
    the nest. Still suspecting nothing, we went after breakfast, to set a
    noose of horse-hair on the nest, a common artifice of the negro boys,
    to capture small birds when sitting. On mounting to set it, however,
    Sam discovered that the nest was quite empty, no trace of the unfledged
    young being left. It is probable that the bird, annoyed at being
    watched, had removed them in her beak, a thing not without precedent.
    Sam assured me, that if a Bald-pate Pigeon be sitting on a nest
    containing young, and be alarmed by a person climbing the tree, so as
    to be driven from the nest, twice in succession, you may look for the
    young the next day, in vain.</p>

  <p>In June I found a nest of the same species on a shrub or young tree
    in the Cotta-wood. It contained one egg; I looked at it, and went a
    little way farther. In a few minutes I returned; the bird was sitting,
    the head and tail oddly projecting from the nest, as usual. I hoped
    to approach without alarming it, but its eye was upon me, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> when I
    was within three or four yards, it flew. I looked into the nest, but
    <em>there was no egg</em>: on search, I found it on the ground beneath,
    much cracked, but not crushed. How could it have come there? The bush,
    to the main stem of which it was attached, was too strong for the
    rising of the bird to have jerked it out; beside which, such result
    was not likely to happen from an action taking place many times every
    day. It must, I think, have been taken out by the bird. I replaced the
    cracked egg, and a day or two afterwards, visited it again: the nest
    was again empty, and evidently deserted.</p>

  <p>On the 12th of November, we took, in Bluefields morass, the nest of a
    Polytmus, containing two eggs, one of which had the chick considerably
    advanced, the other was freshly laid. The nest was placed on a hanging
    twig of a black-mangrove tree, the twig passing perpendicularly through
    the side, and out at the bottom. It is now before me. It is a very
    compact cup, 1&#190; inch deep without, and 1 inch deep within; the sides
    about &#188; inch thick, the inner margin a little overarching, so as to
    narrow the opening: the total diameter at top, 1&#189; inch; 1 inch in
    the clear. It is mainly composed of silk-cotton very closely pressed,
    mixed with the still more glossy cotton of an <i>asclepias</i>,
    particularly around the edge; the seed remaining attached to some of
    the filaments. On the outside the whole structure is quite covered
    with spiders’ web, crossed and recrossed in every direction, and made
    to adhere by some viscous substance, evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> applied after the web
    was placed, probably saliva. Little bits of pale-green lichen, and
    fragments of thin laminated bark, are stuck here and there on the
    outside, by means of the webs having been passed over them. The eggs
    are long-oval, pure white, save that when fresh, the contents produce
    a reddish tinge, from the thinness of the shell. Their long diameter
    ⁷⁄₁₂ inch; short ⁴⁄₁₂. The above may be considered a standard sample
    of the form, dimensions, and materials of the nest of this species.
    Variations, however, often occur from local causes. Thus, in the one
    from Bognie cave, only moss is used, and the base is produced to a
    lengthened point; one of exceeding beauty now before me, is composed
    wholly of pure silk-cotton, bound profusely with the finest web,
    undistinguishable except on close examination; not a fragment of lichen
    mars the beautiful uniformity of its appearance. Others are studded
    all over with the lichens, and these, too, have a peculiar rustic
    prettiness. The situations chosen for nidification, as will have been
    perceived, are very various.</p>

  <p>I have attempted to rear the young from the nest by hand, but without
    complete success. A young friend found a nest in June, on a twig of a
    wild coffee-tree, (<i>Tetramerium odoratissimum</i>,) which contained
    a young bird. He took it, and fed it with sugar and water for some
    days, but when it was full fledged, and almost ready to leave the
    nest, it died and was partially eaten by ants. It was, however, a
    male, and formed an important link in the evidence by which I at
    length discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span> the specific identity of the female. Latham, it is
    true, long ago describes it conjecturally as the female of Polytmus;
    but Lesson, in his “Ois. Mouches,” has treated the supposition as
    groundless. I may observe that to satisfy myself I was in the habit
    of dissecting my specimens, and invariably found, with one exception,
    the green-breasted to be males, the white-breasted to be females.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
    But to return. On the 20th of May of the present year (1846), Sam
    brought me the nest of a Polytmus, which had been affixed to a twig
    of sweet-wood (<i>Laurus</i>). It contained one young, unfledged,
    the feathers just budding, I began to feed it with sugar dissolved
    in water, presented in a quill, which it readily sucked many times
    a-day. Occasionally I caught musquitoes, and other small insects, and
    putting them into the syrup, gave them to the bird; these it seemed
    to like, but particularly ants, which crowded into the sweet fluid
    and overspread its surface. The quill would thus take up a dozen at
    a time, which were sucked in by the little bird with much relish. It
    throve manifestly, and the feathers grew apace, so that on the 29th,
    after having been in my possession nine days, it was almost ready to
    leave the nest. But on that day it died. Another I reared under similar
    circumstances, and in a similar way, until it was actually fledged.
    When nearly full grown, it would rear itself up, touching the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>nest
    only with its feet, on tiptoe, as it were, and vibrate its wings as if
    hovering in flight, for minutes together. At length it fairly took its
    flight out at the window. Both these were females.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> The exception is, that a specimen obtained on the 6th of
      May, in female livery, displayed on dissection two indubitable testes,
      in the ordinary situation.
  </div>

  <p>The young male, when ready to leave the nest, has the throat and breast
    metallic-green as above, the belly-feathers blackish, with large tips
    of green; the tail black with green reflections, untipped. A male which
    I obtained in May, and which I take to be the young of the preceding
    winter, has the green on the head, mingled with black, the disks of
    the feathers being green with a black border. The emerald green of the
    breast is partial in its extent, reaching to the belly only in isolated
    feathers, separated by large spaces of brownish-drab; while on the
    throat and breast, the feathers have merely large round disks of the
    emerald-colour, with narrow edges of brown.</p>

  <p>The tongue of this species, (and doubtless others have a similar
    conformation,) presents, when recent, the appearance of two tubes
    laid side by side, united for half their length, but separate for the
    remainder. Their substance is transparent in the same degree as a good
    quill, which they much resemble: each tube is formed by a lamina rolled
    up, yet not so as to bring the edges into actual contact, for there
    is a longitudinal fissure on the outer side, running up considerably
    higher than the junction of the tubes; into this fissure the point of
    a pin may be inserted and moved up and down the length. Near the tip
    the <em>outer</em> edge of each lamina ceases to be convoluted, but is
    spread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> out, and split at the margin into irregular fimbriæ, which
    point backward, somewhat like the vane of a feather; these are not
    barbs, however, but simply soft and flexible points, such as might
    be produced by snipping diagonally the edge of a strip of paper. I
    conjecture that the nectar of flowers is pumped up the tubes, and
    that minute insects are caught, when in flowers, in these spoon-like
    tips, their minute limbs being perhaps entangled in the fimbriæ, when
    the tongue is retracted into the beak, and the insects swallowed
    by the ordinary process, as doubtless those are which are captured
    with the beak in flight. I do not thoroughly understand the mode by
    which liquids are taken up by a Humming-bird’s tongue, though I have
    carefully watched the process. If syrup be presented to one in a quill,
    the tongue is protruded for about half an inch into the liquor, the
    beak resting in the pen, as it is held horizontal: there is a slight
    but rapid and constant projection and retraction of the tubes, and the
    liquor disappears very fast, perhaps by capillary attraction, perhaps
    by a sort of pumping, certainly not by licking.</p>

  <p>All the Humming-birds have more or less the habit when in flight of
    pausing in the air, and throwing the body and tail into rapid and odd
    contortions; this seems to be most the case with Mango, but perhaps
    is more observable in Polytmus from the effect that such motions have
    on the beautiful long feathers of the tail. That the object of these
    quick turns is the capture of insects I am sure, having watched one
    thus engaged pretty close to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span> me; I drew up and observed it carefully,
    and distinctly saw the minute flies in the air, which it pursued and
    caught, and heard repeatedly the snapping of the beak. My presence
    scarcely disturbed it, if at all.</p>

  <p>The neck in these birds is very long; but appears short, because it
    forms a sigmoid curve downward, which is concealed by the feathers
    of the breast: the trachea is therefore long, and its appearance is
    singular, because the dilatation from which the bronchi divide, is near
    the middle of the whole length, the bronchi being full half an inch in
    length; they run down side by side, however, and are in fact soldered
    together for about half of their length: though the tubes are still
    distinct, as appears by a transverse section. Our two other species I
    have proved to have the same conformation.</p>

  <p>When I left England, I had laid myself out for the attempt to bring
    these radiant creatures alive to this country: and after a little
    acquaintance with the Jamaican species, Polytmus seemed, from its
    beauty, its abundance, its size, its docility, and its mountain
    habitat, to be the species at once most likely to succeed, and most
    worthy of the effort. My expectations were disappointed: yet as the
    efforts themselves made me more familiar with their habits, the reader,
    I trust, will pardon some prolixity of detail in the narration of these
    attempts. Very many were caught by myself and my lads: the narrow path
    on Bluefields peak already mentioned, was the locality to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> we
    resorted on these expeditions. A common gauze butterfly-net, on a ring
    of a foot in diameter and a staff of three or four feet, we found the
    most effective means of capture. The elaborate traps recommended by
    some authors, I fear would suit the natural history of the closet,
    better than that of the woods. We often found the curiosity of these
    little birds stronger than their fear; on holding up the net near one,
    he frequently would not fly away, but come and hover over the mouth,
    stretching out his neck to peep in, so that we could capture them
    with little difficulty. Often too, one when struck at unsuccessfully,
    would return immediately, and suspend itself in the air just above
    our heads, or peep into our faces, with unconquerable familiarity.
    Yet it was difficult to bring these sweet birds, so easily captured,
    home; they were usually dead or dying when we arrived at the house,
    though not wounded or struck. And those which did arrive in apparent
    health, usually died the next day. At my first attempt in the spring
    of 1845, I transferred such as I succeeded in bringing alive, to cages
    immediately on their arrival at the house, and though they did not beat
    themselves, they soon sunk under the confinement. Suddenly they would
    fall to the floor of the cage, and lie motionless with closed eyes;
    if taken into the hand, they would perhaps seem to revive for a few
    moments; then throw back the pretty head, or toss it to and fro as if
    in great suffering, expand the wings, open the eyes, slightly puff up
    the feathers of the breast, and die: usually without any convulsive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
    struggle. This was the fate of my first attempts.</p>

  <p>In the autumn, however, they began to be numerous again upon the
    mountain, and having, on the 13th of November, captured two young
    males sucking the pretty pink flowers of <i>Urena lobata</i>, I
    brought them home in a covered basket. The tail-feathers of the one
    were undeveloped, those of the other half their full length. I did not
    cage them but turned them out into the open room in which the daily
    work of preparing specimens was carried on, having first secured the
    doors and windows. They were lively, but not wild; playful towards
    each other, and tame with respect to myself, sitting unrestrained for
    several seconds at a time on my finger. I collected a few flowers and
    placed them in a vase on a high shelf, and to these they resorted
    immediately. But I soon found that they paid attention to none but
    <i>Asclepias curassavica,</i> and slightly to a large <i>Ipomea</i>. On
    this I again went out, and gathered a large bunch of <i>Asclepias</i>,
    and was pleased to observe that on the moment of my entering the room,
    one flew to the nosegay, and sucked while I held it in my hand. The
    other soon followed, and then both these lovely creatures were buzzing
    together within an inch of my face, probing the flowers so eagerly, as
    to allow their bodies to be touched without alarm. These flowers being
    placed in another glass, they visited each bouquet in turn, now and
    then flying after each other playfully through the room, or alighting
    on various objects.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> Though occasionally they flew against the window,
    they did not flutter and beat themselves at it, but seemed well content
    with their parole. As they flew, I repeatedly heard them snap the
    beak, at which times, they doubtless caught minute flies. After some
    time, one of them suddenly sunk down in one corner, and on being taken
    up seemed dying: it had perhaps struck itself in flying. It lingered
    awhile, and died. The other continued his vivacity; perceiving that he
    had exhausted the flowers, I prepared a tube, made of the barrel of a
    goose-quill, which I inserted into the cork of a bottle to secure its
    steadiness and upright position, and filled with juice of sugar-cane.
    I then took a large <i>Ipomea</i>, and having cut off the bottom, I
    slipped the flower over the tube, so that the quill took the place of
    the nectary of the flower. The bird flew to it in a moment, clung to
    the bottle rim, and bringing his beak perpendicular, thrust it into
    the tube. It was at once evident that the repast was agreeable, for he
    continued pumping for several seconds, and on his flying off, I found
    the quill emptied. As he had torn off the flower in his eagerness for
    more, and even followed the fragments of the corolla, as they lay on
    the table, to search them, I refilled the quill and put a blossom
    of the Marvel of Peru into it, so that the flower expanded over the
    top. The little toper found it again, and after drinking freely,
    withdrew his beak, but the blossom was adhering to it as a sheath.
    This incumbrance he presently got rid of, and then, (which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span> was most
    interesting to me,) he returned immediately, and inserting his beak
    into the bare quill, finished the contents. It was amusing to see the
    odd position of his head and body as he clung to the bottle, with his
    beak inserted perpendicularly into the cork. Several times, in the
    course of the evening, he had recourse to his new fountain, which was
    as often replenished for him, and at length about sunset betook himself
    to a line stretched across the room, for repose. He slept, as they all
    do, with the head not behind the wing, but slightly drawn back on the
    shoulders, and in figure reminded me of Mr. Gould’s beautiful plate of
    <i>Trogon resplendens</i>, in miniature. In the morning, I found him
    active before sunrise, already having visited his quill of syrup, which
    he emptied a second time. After some hours, he flew through a door
    which I had incautiously left open, and darting through the window of
    the next room, escaped, to my no small chagrin.</p>

  <p>Three males, captured on Bluefields peak on the 22nd of April, were
    brought home alive. They at once became familiar on being turned into
    the room, and one, the boldest, found out immediately a glass of
    sugar-syrup, and sipped repeatedly at it. One of them disappeared in
    the course of the next day, doubtless by falling into some obscure
    corner behind the furniture. The others, however, appeared quite at
    home, and one soon became so familiar, even before I had had him a
    day, as to fly to my face, and perching on my lip or chin, thrust his
    beak into my mouth, and suck up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span> moisture. He grew so bold, and
    so frequent in his visits, as at length to become almost annoying;
    and so pertinacious as to thrust his protruded tongue into all parts
    of my mouth, searching between the gum and cheek, beneath the tongue,
    &amp;c. Occasionally, I gratified him by taking into my mouth a little of
    the syrup, and inviting him by a slight sound, which he learned to
    understand; and this appeared to please his palate. Bouquets of fresh
    flowers they did not appear much to regard; but one or two species of
    <i>Lantana</i> seemed more attractive than the rest. I expected that
    the honeyed and fragrant bunches of blossom of the <i>Moringa</i>,
    which on the tree is perpetually visited by them, would tempt my
    captives, but after a brief trial, they disregarded them. Perhaps
    it was because they could sate their appetite more freely and fully
    at the syrup glass, which they frequently visited, but only sipped.
    They always clung to the glass with their feet, and very often to the
    flowers also. Each selected his own places of perching; there were
    lines stretched across the room, for drying bird-skins; and from the
    first each took a place on one of the lines, distant from the other,
    where he then invariably roosted, and rested. Each selected also one
    or two other stations for temporary alighting, but each adhered to his
    own, without invading his neighbour’s. So strong was this predilection,
    that on my driving one away from his spot, he would flutter round the
    room, but return and try to alight there again, and if still prevented,
    would hover round the place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> as if much distressed. This preference
    of a particular twig for alighting is observable in freedom, and will
    suggest an analogy with the Flycatchers. I have not observed it in
    our other species. It gave us a means of capturing many, in addition
    to the net; for by observing a spot of resort, and putting a little
    birdlime on that twig, we could be pretty sure of a bird in a few
    minutes. The boldest was rather pugnacious, occasionally attacking
    his gentler and more confiding companion, who always yielded and
    fled; when the assailant would perch and utter a succession of shrill
    chirps, “<em>screep, screep, screep</em>.” After a day
    or two, however, the persecuted one plucked up courage, and actually
    played the tyrant in his turn, interdicting his fellow from sipping at
    the sweetened cup. Twenty times in succession would the thirsty bird
    drop down upon the wing to the glass,—which stood at the edge of a
    table immediately beneath that part of the line, where both at length
    were wont to perch,—but no sooner was he poised in front and about to
    insert his tongue, than the other would dart down with inconceivable
    swiftness, and wheeling so as to come up beneath him, would drive
    him away from his repast. He might fly to any other part of the room
    unmolested, but an approach to the cup was the signal for an instant
    assault. The ill-natured fellow himself drank long and frequent
    draughts. I noticed that no sooner had this individual recovered his
    boldness than he recovered his voice also, and both would <em>screep</em>
    pertinaciously and shrilly, almost without intermission. When they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
    were accustomed to the room, their vivacity was extreme, manifested in
    their upright posture, and quick turns and glances when sitting, which
    caused their lovely breasts to flash out from darkness into sudden
    lustrous light like rich gems;—and no less by their dartings hither and
    thither, their most graceful wheelings and evolutions in the air; so
    rapid that the eye was frequently baffled in attempting to follow their
    motions. Suddenly we lose the radiant little meteor in one corner, and
    as quickly hear the vibration of his invisible wings in another behind
    us: or find him hovering in front of our face, without having seen, in
    the least, how he came there. It is worthy of observation that Polytmus
    in flying upward, keeps the feathers of the tail closed, but in
    descending they are expanded to the utmost, at which time the two long
    feathers, quivering with the rapidity of their motion, like a streamer
    in a gale, form about a right angle. I cannot tell why there should be
    this difference, but I believe it is invariable.</p>

  <p>From that time to the end of May, I obtained about twenty-five more,
    nearly all males, and with one or two exceptions captured on the
    Bluefields ridge. Some were taken with the net, others with bird-lime;
    but though transferred to a basket or to a cage immediately on capture,
    not a few were found dead on arrival at home. This sudden death I could
    not at all account for: they did not beat themselves against the sides,
    though they frequently clung to them: from the wild look of several
    that were alive when arrived, sitting on the bottom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> the cage,
    looking upwards, I suspect terror, at their capture and novel position,
    had no small influence. Many of those which were found alive, were
    in a dying state, and of those which were turned out into the room,
    several more died in the first twenty-four hours; generally, because,
    not observing the lines which the domesticated ones used as perches,
    they would fly against the perpendicular walls, where, after fluttering
    awhile suspended, they would at length sink, exhausted, perpendicularly
    downwards, the wings still vibrating, and alight on the object that
    intercepted their downward course. If this was the floor, they would
    presently rise on the wing, only again to flutter against the wall as
    before; but often it would happen that they would sink behind some of
    the many boxes with which the shelves were lumbered; in which case
    the space being too narrow for the use of their wings, they soon died
    unobserved, and were found dead only upon searching. This was the fate
    of many; so that out of the twenty-five, only seven were domesticated.
    These, however, became quite at home; and I may here observe that there
    was much difference in the tempers of individuals; some being moody
    and sulky, others very timid, and others gentle and confiding from the
    first. I have noticed this in other birds also; Doves, for instance,
    which manifest individuality of character, perhaps as much as men, if
    we were competent to appreciate it. My ordinary plan of accustoming
    them to the room, and teaching them to feed, was very simple.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span> On
    opening the basket in which one or more newly-caught Humming-birds were
    brought home, they would fly out, and commonly soar to the ceiling,
    rarely seeking the window; there for awhile, or against the walls,
    as above mentioned, they would flutter, not beating themselves, but
    hanging on rapidly vibrating wings, lightly touching the plaster with
    the beak or breast, every second, and thus slightly rebounding. By
    keeping a strict watch on them while so occupied, we could observe
    when they became exhausted, and sunk rapidly down to alight; commonly,
    they would then suffer themselves to be raised, by passing the finger
    under the breast, to which they would apply their little feet. Having
    thus raised one on my finger, and taken a little sugar into my mouth,
    I inserted its beak between my lips. Sometimes it would at once begin
    to suck eagerly; but at other times it was needful to invite it thus
    many times, before it would notice the sugar: by persevering, however,
    they commonly learned. And when one had once fed from the mouth, it was
    always ready to suck afterwards, and frequently, as above narrated,
    voluntarily sought my lips. Having given one his first lesson, I
    gently presented him to the line, and drawing my finger from under
    him, he would commonly take to it, but if not, the proceeding had to
    be repeated: and even when perched, the repetition of the feeding and
    placing on the line was needful to induce the habit. If the bird’s
    temper were kindly, it soon began to perch on the line of its own
    accord; when I ceased to feed it from my lips, presenting to it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
    instead, the glass of syrup. After it had sucked thus a time or two,
    it found it as it stood at the edge of a table; and I considered it
    domesticated. Its time was now spent in incessant short flights about
    the room, alternating with momentary rests on the line; often darting
    to another on the wing, when the most rapid and beautiful evolutions
    would take place, in which the long tail-feathers whisked about in a
    singular manner. I believe these rencontres were all amicable, for
    they never appeared to come into actual contact, nor to suffer any
    inconvenience from them. After close observation to ascertain the fact,
    I was fully convinced that the object of their incessant sallies on
    the wing was the capture of minute insects; so minute that they were
    generally undistinguishable to the human eye. Yet the action of the
    bird shewed that something was pursued and taken, and though from the
    extreme rapidity of their motions, I could not often see the capture,
    yet several times I did detect the snap of the beak, and once or twice
    witnessed the taking of some little fly, just large enough to be
    discerned in the air. Moreover, the flights were sometimes very short;
    a leap out upon the wing to the distance of a foot or two, and then a
    return to the perch, just as the true Fly-catchers do; which indeed the
    Humming-birds are, to all intents and purposes, and most accomplished
    ones. I judge, that, on a low estimate, each captured on the wing
    at least three insects per minute, and that, with few intervals,
    incessantly, from dawn to dusk. Abroad I do not think quite so many
    would be taken in the air, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span> more normal way being, I presume, the
    securing of the minute creatures that inhabit the tubes of flowers;
    yet we perpetually see them hawking even at liberty. My captives would
    occasionally fly to the walls, and pick from the spiders’ webs, with
    which they were draped. When they rested, they sat in nearly an upright
    posture, the head usually thrown a little back, and the crimson beak
    pointing at a small angle above the horizon, the feet almost hidden,
    the belly being brought into contact with the perch, the tail somewhat
    thrown in under the body, and the long feathers crossing each other
    near their middle. Their ordinary mode of coming down to drink was
    curious. I have said that their little reservoir of syrup was placed
    at the edge of a table, about two feet beneath them. Instead of flying
    down soberly in a direct line, which would have been far too dull for
    the volatile genius of a Humming-bird, they invariably made a dozen
    or twenty distinct stages of it, each in a curve descending a little,
    and ascending nearly to the same plane, and hovering a second or two
    at every angle; and sometimes when they arrived opposite the cup more
    quickly than usual, as if they considered it reached too soon, they
    would make half a dozen more horizontal traverses before they would
    bring their tiny feet to the edge of the glass and insert their sucking
    tongue. They were very frequently sipping, though they did not take
    much at a time; five birds about emptied a wine-glass per diem. Their
    fæcal discharges were altogether fluid, and exactly resembled the
    syrup which they imbibed. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> rather late in retiring to roost,
    frequently hawking and sporting till dusk; and when settled for the
    night, were restless, and easily disturbed. The entrance of a person
    with a candle, at any hour, was liable to set one or two upon the wing;
    and this was always a matter of regret with me, because of the terror
    which they seemed to feel, incapacitating them from again finding the
    perching line. On such occasions they would again flutter against the
    walls, and sink down, as when first captured, with the same danger of
    accident, if not closely watched, and picked up when exhausted. After
    having inhabited my specimen-room for some time, (those, first caught
    almost four weeks,) I transferred them, five in number, all males, to a
    large cage with a wired front, and two transverse perches; I had much
    dreaded this change, and therefore did it in the evening, hoping that
    the intervening night would calm them. I had in some measure prepared
    them for the change by placing the cage (before the front was affixed)
    upon the table some days previously, and setting their syrup-cup
    first close to the cage, then a little within, then a little farther,
    until at length it stood at the remotest corner. And I was pleased to
    observe that the birds followed the cup every day, flying in and out
    of the cage to sip, though at first very shyly and suspiciously, many
    times flying in and suddenly darting out without tasting the fluid.
    After I had shut them in, they beat and fluttered a good deal; but by
    the next day I was gratified to find that all had taken their places
    quietly on the perches, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> sipped at the syrup, though rather less
    than usual. I had now high hopes of bringing them alive to England,
    thinking the most difficult task was over; especially as within a day
    or two after, I added to them two more males, one of which presently
    learned both to perch and to find the cup, and also a female. The
    latter interested me much, for on the next day after her introduction,
    I noticed that she had seated herself by a long-tailed male, on a perch
    occupied only by them two, and was evidently courting his caresses. She
    would hop sideways along the perch by a series of little quick jumps,
    till she reached him, when she would gently peck his face, and then
    recede, hopping and shivering her wings, and presently approach again
    to perform the same actions. Now and then she would fly over him, and
    make as if she were about to perch on his back, and practise other
    little endearments; to which, however, I am sorry to say, he seemed
    most ungallantly indifferent, being, in fact, the dullest of the whole
    group. I expected to have them nidificate in the cage, and therefore
    affixed a very inviting twig of lime-tree to the cage wall, and threw
    in plenty of cotton, and perhaps should have succeeded, but for the
    carelessness of my servant. For he having incautiously left open the
    cage door, the female flew out and effected her escape.</p>

  <p>But all my hopes of success were soon to be quashed; for after they
    had been in cage but a week, they began to die, sometimes two in a
    day; and in another week, but a solitary individual was left, which
    soon followed the others. I vainly endeavoured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> to replace them, by
    sending to the mountain; for where the species was so numerous two
    months before, they were now (beginning of June) scarcely to be seen
    at all. The cause of the death of my caged captives, I conjecture to
    have been the want of insect food; that, notwithstanding their frequent
    sipping at the syrup, they were really starved to death. I was led to
    this conclusion, by having found, on dissecting those which died, that
    they were excessively meagre in flesh, and that the stomach, which
    ordinarily is as large as a pea, and distended with insects, was,
    in these, shrunken to a minute collapsed membrane, with difficulty
    distinguished. If I had an opportunity of trying the experiment
    again, with the advantage of this experience, I would proceed rather
    differently. I would have a very capacious cage, wired <em>on every
    side</em>, in the bottom of which a supply of decaying fruit, such as
    oranges or pines, should be constantly kept, but covered with wire that
    the birds might not defile their plumage. This, as I have proved, would
    attract immense numbers of minute flies, which, flitting to and fro
    in the cage, would probably afford sufficient sustenance to the birds
    in conjunction with the syrup. The birds, however, should be caged as
    short a time as possible before sailing, which might be early in May;
    and by a steamer, which calling at St. Thomas, Bermuda, and the Azores,
    large bunches of fresh flowers, and even herbage, might be obtained at
    short intervals on the voyage, with which, of course, a multitude of
    insects would be introduced. Thus, I still think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> these lovely birds
    might be introduced into our conservatories and stoves, where there
    would be no difficulty in preserving them. Mr. Yarrell has suggested to
    me, that possibly young ones fed from the nest upon syrup alone, might
    be able to live without insect food.</p>

  <p>That this is the species of which M. Lesson has figured the female
    in his Oiseaux Mouches, pl. 79, there can be no doubt. His figure is
    a very fair representation; though it is too slender, and the white
    mark behind the eye I cannot find: this, however, I do not wonder
    at, if, as is most probable, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>his figure was taken from a dried
    specimen. He says, “it is beyond contradiction the smallest of all
    those yet known, and without doubt is the ‘very little Humming-bird’
    of voyagers. Its length is 2 inches and 4 lines.” But that it is the
    <i>Trochilus minimus</i> of Linnæus, Buffon, Edwards, and Latham, who
    can imagine, that puts any faith in testimony? Edwards’ figure, which
    is said to be “of its natural bigness,” measures 1⁴⁄₁₀ inch; that
    in the Pl. Enl. 276. fig. 1, is about 1³⁄₁₀; and Latham, who says
    expressly, “<em>I have received</em> this from Jamaica,” gives its total
    length 1&#188; inch, and that of its beak, 3&#189; lines. It is true the
    description as to colouring, &amp;c., bears a very close resemblance to
    mine, but no one accustomed to the precision of science could mistake
    2&#189; inches for 1&#188;!<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Neither is it possible that these minute
    specimens can be the <em>young</em> of the present species; for nestling
    Humming-birds, even when not half-fledged, are very little less in
    size than the adult, and, when able to leave the nest, are scarcely
    to be distinguished as to dimensions. Moreover, having reared this
    species I can speak positively. But Mr. Bullock records having obtained
    in Jamaica a species whose body was but half an inch in length; this
    specimen is understood to have become the possession of the late George
    Loddiges, Esq., and I have been assured by an <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>ornithological friend,
    who has seen it, that it is no larger than the species of the old
    naturalists. Under these considerations, Lesson’s name being manifestly
    misapplied, I have ventured to give to the present species, a new
    appellation, derived from its habit of buzzing over the low herbaceous
    plants of pastures, which our other species do not. The West Indian
    vervain (<i>Stachytarpheta</i>) is one of the most common weeds in
    neglected pastures, shooting up everywhere its slender columns, set
    round with blue flowers, to the height of a foot. About these our
    little Humming-bird is abundant during the summer months, probing the
    azure blossoms a few inches from the ground. It visits the spikes in
    succession, flitting from one to another, exactly in the manner of the
    honey-bee, and with the same business-like industry and application.
    In the winter, the abundance of other flowers and the paucity of
    vervain-blossoms, induce its attentions to the hedgerows and woods.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> Yet Sloane describes his “Least Humming-bird,” (Jam. 308)
      as “about 1&#188; inch long, from the end of the bill to that of the
      tail,” while of his figure the bill alone measures &#190; inch, and the
      whole bird 2⁵⁄₈. As the worthy Doctor, however, is said to have taken
      his admeasurements with his <em>thumb-nail</em>, this slight variation is
      the less surprising.
  </div>

  <p>I have sometimes watched, with much delight, the evolutions of this
    little species at the moringa tree already spoken of. When only one is
    present, he pursues the round of the blossoms soberly enough, sucking
    as he goes, and now and anon sitting quietly on a twig. But if two are
    about the tree, one will fly off, and, suspending himself in the air
    a few yards distant, the other presently shoots off to him, and then,
    without touching each other, they mount upward with a strong rushing
    of wings, perhaps for five hundred feet. Then they separate, and
    each shoots diagonally towards the ground, like a ball from a rifle,
    and wheeling round, comes up to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> blossoms again, and sucks, and
    sucks, as if it had not moved away at all. Frequently one alone will
    mount in this manner, or dart on invisible wing diagonally upward,
    looking exactly like a humble-bee. Indeed, the figure of the smaller
    Humming-birds on the wing, their rapidity, their arrowy course, and
    their whole manner of flight, are entirely those of an insect; and one
    who has watched the flight of a large beetle or bee, will have a very
    good idea of the form of one of these tropic gems, painted against
    the sky. I have observed all our three species at one time engaged
    in sucking the blossoms of the moringa at Content; and have noticed
    that whereas Polytmus and Mango expand and depress the tail, when
    hovering before flowers, Humilis, on the contrary, for the most part,
    <em>erects</em> the tail; but not invariably.</p>

  <p>The present is the only Humming-bird that I am acquainted with, that
    has a real song. Soon after sunrise in the spring months, it is fond
    of sitting on the topmost twig of some mango or orange tree, where it
    warbles, in a very weak but very sweet tone, a continuous melody, for
    ten minutes at a time: it has little variety. The others have only a
    pertinacious chirping.</p>

  <p>The season of nidification seems to be as protracted in this, as in
    the former species; nor does the structure itself differ, except in
    being of about half the size. The small bushes of <i>Lantana</i>,
    so common by roadsides, and always covered with orange and yellow
    blossom, are favourite situations for the domestic economy of this
    minim bird. The smooth twigs of the bamboo also are not unfrequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
    chosen. It is not an uncommon thing in Jamaica, for a road up a
    mountain to be cut in zig-zag terraces to diminish the steepness; and,
    to prevent the lower side of such a road from crumbling away, stems
    of green bamboo are cut and laid in a shallow trench along the edge.
    Shoots spring from every joint, and presently a close row of living
    palisades are growing along the margin of the road, whose roots, as
    they spread, effectually bind together the mountain-side, and make the
    terrace perpetual; while, as they increase in height and thickness,
    they throw their gracefully-waving tufts over the way, like gigantic
    ostrich plumes, affording most refreshing shadow from the heat. Such a
    <em>bamboo-walk</em>, as it is called, winds up the steep side of Grand
    Vale mountain in St. Elizabeth’s, and here the nests of the Vervain
    Humming-bird are frequently met with.</p>

  <p>One day in June, being up this road, I found two nests attached to
    twigs of bamboo, and one just commenced. Two parallel twigs were
    connected together by spiders’ webs, profusely but irregularly
    stretched across, and these held a layer of silk-cotton, which just
    filled up the space (about an inch square) between them. This was the
    base. The others were complete cups of silk-cotton exceedingly compact
    and neat, ornamented outside with bits of grey lichen, stuck about.
    Usually the nest is placed on a joint of a bamboo branch, and the
    diverging twigs are embraced by the base. The nest is about the size of
    half a walnut-shell, if divided not lengthwise, but transversely. To
    see the bird sitting in this tiny structure is amusing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> The head and
    tail are both excluded, the latter erect like a wren’s: and the bright
    eyes glance in every direction. One of these contained two eggs, the
    other a single young nearly fledged, which, with the nest, I carried to
    Content to rear.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to observe the cleanliness of animals; the dung of
    young birds would greatly inconvenience them in the nest, and probably
    cause disease; it is therefore wisely ordained that there should be
    some mode of getting rid of it. Swallows carry out the excrement of
    their young in their beaks; and this they are able to do, as at that
    early season it is enclosed in a tenacious jelly. I observed with
    admiration, and with adoration, of the tender mercy of God in directing
    such minutiæ as these, for the comfort of His creatures, that this
    little Humming-bird, while I was carrying it, elevating its body above
    the edge of the nest, in the bottom of which it ordinarily lay, ejected
    the alvine discharge in a forcible jet, to the distance of several feet.</p>

  <p>This little nestling I attempted to rear, and had every prospect of
    succeeding, for it eagerly received the juice of sugar-cane, which I
    administered to it in a small quill, many times in the day, sometimes
    adding small insects, as in a former case. But on the third day I was
    necessitated to return to Bluefields, and rode fifteen miles with the
    bird in my hand, enclosed in an open box. I took every care of it; but
    whether from too long fasting, or from the shaking, or exposure to the
    sun, I know not, but it was dying when I arrived, and a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> minutes
    put an end to its sufferings and my expectations.</p>

  <p>Several times I have enclosed a nest of eggs in a gauzed cage, with
    the dam, taken in the act of sitting; but in no case did she survive
    twenty-four hours’ confinement, or take the slightest notice of her
    nest. When engaged in the attempt to domesticate a colony of Polytmus,
    an opportunity offered to add this minute species to my aviary. For at
    that time two large tamarind-trees very near the house were in full
    blossom, and round them the Vervain Humming-bird was swarming. I never
    saw so many of this tribe at once; they flocked together, as Sam truly
    observed, “like bees,” and the air resounded with their humming, as if
    in the neighbourhood of a hive. We caught several with the net, but
    could make nothing of them; they were indomitably timid. When turned
    into the room, they shot away into the loftiest angle of the ceiling,
    and there hovered motionless, or sometimes slowly turning as if on
    a pivot, their wings all the time vibrating with such extraordinary
    velocity as to be visible only as a semicircular film on each side. The
    fact that the extent of the vibration reached 180°, (or so nearly that
    it seemed to me such,) shews the immense power of the small muscles
    by which the wings are put in motion. Neither of our other species
    approaches either the rapidity or extent of this oscillation; and hence
    with this bird alone does the sound produced by the vibration of the
    wings acquire the sharpness of an insect’s hum. The noise produced by
    the hovering of Polytmus is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> whirring exactly like that of a wheel
    put into rapid revolution by machinery; that of Humilis is a hum, like
    that of a large bee.</p>

  <p>The spirit of curiosity is manifested by this little bird as well as
    by the larger species. When struck at, it will return in a moment,
    and peep into the net, or hover just in front of one’s face. The
    stories told of Humming-birds attacking men, and striking at the eyes
    with their needle-like bills, originated, I have no doubt, in the
    exaggeration of fear, misinterpreting this innocent curiosity.</p>

  <p>This pretty bird, whose lot has been to oscillate in the systems of
    naturalists from the Warblers to the Creepers and from the Creepers
    to the Warblers, appears to have as much ambiguity in its manners as
    in its structure. One day I noticed it, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>watched its proceedings,
    in one of the spreading Black-withes, that form large tangled masses
    of long slender branches over a clear space of mud in the morasses,
    the topmost stratum of which alone is furnished with leaves, but that
    dense enough, not only with its own foliage, but also with the drapery
    of convolvulus that is usually hung in profusion over it. The little
    bird was mounting from the bottom hopping from twig to twig, searching
    and picking as it went up; when it reached the bushy top, it suddenly
    descended, apparently by dropping perpendicularly to the bottom, where
    it picked a little about the mud, then mounted gradually, and dropped
    as before. After proceeding thus two or three times, I secured it.</p>

  <p>At other times it affects the trunks of trees, even large ones, like a
    true Creeper, hopping diagonally up the perpendicular bole, and when at
    a good height, dropping down upon the wing, to alight again near the
    root, and proceed upward in another line. Now and then it stops to pick
    small insects from the crevices of the bark: and this sort of food I
    have always found in its stomach.</p>

  <p>It is rather common in Jamaica during the winter months: we first saw
    it on the 26th of September, and last on the 30th of April.</p>

  <p>The following interesting note accompanies a very correct drawing of
    this species by Robinson (Birds: large Folio):—“Motacilla alba et nigra
    varia.—It was pursued by a Hawk, and took sanctuary in Chateau-morant
    House. Mr. Holladay, overseer at Chateau in Clarendon, made me a
    present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> of the live bird, December 24th, 1760. It was very tame, and
    so hungry that it picked some feathers out of a dead bird, and ate
    them. It weighed somewhat less than two drachms.”</p>

  <p>The birds on which the peasantry in any country have conferred homely
    abbreviations of human names, are, I think, only such as have something
    lively and entertaining in their manners. Examples of familiar birds
    will at once occur to an English reader, and the subject of the
    present note is by no means an exception to the rule. He is one of the
    liveliest of our Jamaican birds: in woody places his clear whistle
    perpetually strikes the ear of the passenger, as he sits among the
    close foliage, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>or darts across the glade. Not unfrequently we are
    startled by a shrill scream in some lonely place, and out rushes the
    Hopping Dick, jumping with rapidity across the road, almost close to
    our horse’s feet. He greatly reminds me of the English Blackbird,
    in his sable plumage, and bright yellow beak, but especially when
    hopping along the branches of some pimento tree, or upon the sward
    beneath, in those beautiful park-like estates called <em>pens</em>. The
    keen glancing of his eye, his quick turns and odd gesticulations, the
    elevation of his long tail almost erect, his nods and jerks, have in
    them an uncommon vivacity, which is not belied by his loud voice, as he
    repeats a high mellow note four or five times in rapid succession, just
    preparatory to, or during, his sudden flights from tree to tree. His
    notes are various: sometimes we hear him in the lone wood, uttering,
    <em>click, click, click</em>, without variation of tone
    or intermission, for many minutes together. His <em>song</em> which I
    have heard only in spring, is rich and mellow, much like the English
    Blackbird’s: he sits in some thick tree, or wood, particularly at
    earliest dawn, and pours forth his clear notes in a broken strain, and
    often in a subdued tone, as if singing only to please himself.</p>

  <p>I happened to wound slightly two of these birds on the same day,
    which I placed in a cage. They were free and easy from the first,
    very clamorous, lively and even headlong in their sudden movements.
    I found that they would seize and devour with eagerness cockroaches,
    hard beetles, worms, and even small lizards. I gave them a bunch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
    the ripe, but dry and insipid, berries of a species of <i>ficus</i>,
    which they readily picked off and ate. The fruit of this fig they are
    fond of in a state of freedom; and such is their impudence that they
    prevent the Baldpate Pigeons, though so much bigger, from partaking.
    The Baldpates would willingly eat the little figs also, but the Hopping
    Dicks scream and fly at them, and peck their backs, so as to keep them
    fluttering from branch to branch, reluctant to depart, yet unable to
    eat in comfort.</p>

  <p>At the break of day, if we pass along a wooded mountain road, such as
    that lonely one at Basin-spring, in Westmoreland, particularly when
    the parching winds called <em>norths</em> have set in, in December and
    January,—we see the Hopping Dicks bounding singly along the ground in
    every part; but during the day they resort in numbers to the diminished
    springs and ponds which yet remain, where, after quenching their
    thirst, they enjoy the luxury of a bathe.</p>

  <p>In the high mountains behind Spanish Town, this bird is called the
    Twopenny chick; but in the parishes of Westmoreland and St. Elizabeth,
    I have heard him distinguished only by the homely appellation which
    I have adopted. He is not confined to any particular locality. Dr.
    Chamberlaine (<cite>Jam. Alm.</cite>) has “never seen him in the lowlands.”
    But around Bluefields he is abundant, especially in the little belt
    of wood that girds the sandy sea-beach at Belmont, where one may meet
    with him at all times. In the pastures of Mount Edgecumbe he is no less
    common. In the highest districts, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> Bluefields Peaks, though I have
    sometimes seen him, he is chiefly represented by his congener, the
    Glass-eye: in the solitudes of Basin-spring, a lower elevation, both
    species are numerous.</p>

  <p>In some “Contributions to Ornithology,” by Dr. Richard Chamberlaine,
    published in the Companion to the Jamaica Almanack for 1842, this
    bird is described. The following observations are there quoted from
    a letter of Mr. Hill’s to the Doctor:—“I paid a visit the other day
    to the Highgate mountains, a district in which our native Ouzel, the
    Hopping Dick, is exceedingly abundant. On asking one morning the name
    of the bird, whose clear, mellow-toned whistle I was then listening to,
    a negro told me it was the <em>Hopping Dick</em>, and that they ‘always
    hear him when the long days begin.’ The long days had not yet begun;
    but at early dawn, while the distant horizon was seen but faintly
    gleaming through the dull grey break of daylight, and many of these
    Merles were gliding from one thicket to another, and dashing across the
    road with that bounding run from which they derive their sobriquet of
    Hopping Dick, one bird anticipated the season of song, by repeatedly
    sounding two or three cadences of that full deep whistle with which he
    salutes the lengthening year.</p>

  <p>“The forests skirting the mountain are his favourite haunt. If he
    frequents the open slopes and crests of the hills, he glides from tree
    to tree, just above the surface of the grass. If he rises above the
    lower branches of the pimento, or into some of the loftier shrubs, it
    is to visit the <i>Tillandsias</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> or parasitical wild-pines, to
    drink from within the heart-leaves at those reservoirs of collected
    dews which are the only resource of the birds in these high mountains.
    His dark sooty plumage, his brilliant orange bill, and his habit, when
    surprised or disturbed, of escaping by running or flying low, and
    sounding all the while his alarm scream till he gets away into the
    thicket, completely identify him with the European Blackbird.</p>

  <p>“It was in the month of July, in 1834, that I first heard the song of
    this Ouzel, which I would call <i>Merula Saltator</i>, as this name
    preserves his distinctive sobriquet of Hopping Dick, and refers to
    his characteristic length of legs, both at the tarsus and the thighs.
    The shock of an earthquake had wakened all the living tenants of
    the plantation at which I was staying, when the voice of this bird,
    as the alarm lulled into silence, was heard from a small coppice of
    cedar-trees, clear and mellow. Though it was less varied than the song
    of the European Blackbird, it was very much like its tones when it is
    heard over distant fields in a summer’s morning. I had been apprised
    that I should hear it there, for it had sung in that grove daily at
    that season for three or four years; and though under the disadvantage
    of being an anticipated song, it was a very agreeable recognition of
    the melody of the European bird.</p>

  <p>“The next time I heard his music was in the month of May, 1836, in the
    same mountains. The rains of the season had terminated, or only mid-day
    showers fell, the mornings and evenings being refreshing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> and brilliant
    It was now not a single one of these birds that I heard singing lonely
    in a sequestered cluster of trees, but a hundred of them far and near,
    blending their voices together, or vying with each other in rivalry of
    song. My frequent weekly journeys in these districts, from this period
    to the end of August, were always cheered by this simultaneous outburst
    of melody from the <i>Merula saltator</i>.”</p>

  <p>I found a nest of this bird one day in the middle of August; it was
    affixed to the highest perpendicular limb of a rather tall pimento in
    Mount Edgecumbe, and consisted of a rude cup formed of the slender
    roots of pimento, and placed on a platform of leaves and small twigs.
    It contained two young, almost fledged, which flew to the ground before
    they could be seized,—and one abortive egg. The young displayed the
    plumage of the adult, even to the white webs on the two coverts; but
    the eyes were dark greyish-brown, the beak blackish, and the feet,
    dull, horny yellow. The egg measures 1⁴⁄₁₀ inch: by ⁹⁄₁₀: it is white,
    thickly splashed with dark and pale reddish-brown. Sometimes, as I have
    been informed, a decaying stump is selected, or any other convenient
    hollow, into which the bird carries “plantain trash,” or similar
    materials, and forms a rude nest, laying three or four eggs. And Mr.
    Hill gives me a statement of a locality which is intermediate between
    these; observing, “A friend of mine found the nest of a Hopping Dick.
    It was built amid the dry leaves that had lodged within the forks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> of a
    low branch of a mango-tree. It was a structure of small sticks, loosely
    woven, in the centre of which the young birds nestled among dried
    foliage.”</p>

  <p>This is exclusively a mountain bird; inhabiting the very same
    localities, and subsisting on the same food as the Solitaire, presently
    to be described; the pulpy berries of a Scrophularious shrub, which
    the negroes thence call <em>Glass-eye berry</em>. I have never found
    any animal substance in the stomach of this species, numbers of
    which I have examined; one in December contained many of the little
    scarlet figs, from the tree on which I shot it: in February the green
    pimento-berries are devoured by them; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>and later in the spring,
    it appears, the shining fruit of the Sweetwood (<i>Laurus</i>) is
    attractive to them. On the 30th of March, my lad shot a male Glass-eye
    by the road-side at Cave, scarcely a stone’s throw from the sea, and
    level with it; the stomach contained the berries of this <i>Laurus</i>,
    which is abundant just there. This is the only instance in which I ever
    heard of the species, except in a mountain locality.</p>

  <p>The common names of this bird are bestowed in allusion to the tint of
    the iris of the eye: this, as Mr. Hill observes, “is not absolutely
    white, but so transparently suffused with a hue of olive, that the eye
    has the look of very common glass.”</p>

  <p>The figure, attitudes, and motions of the Glass-eye are those of its
    fellow, the Hopping Dick; it is, however, much more recluse, and
    jealous of being seen. The dashing manner of flight across the narrow
    wood-paths are the same in both birds, but the loud and startling tones
    of the lowland bird are wanting in this. The Glass-eye has but one
    note <em>that I have heard</em>; a single low “<em>quank</em>,” frequently
    repeated as he hops from bush to bush, or plunges into the thicket.
    Dr. Chamberlaine attributes to him “the same loud sonorous chirp as
    he stealthily scuds from one dark recess of the forest to another;”
    but I should think him mistaken, were it not that Robinson, who gives
    a very correct drawing of the species by the name of <i>Turdus capite
    ferrugineo</i>, and describes it as common in the Liguanea mountains,
    affirms that “it whistles like our English Blackbirds.” (MSS.)</p>

  <p>One of the very commonest of birds in Jamaica, bold and forward in his
    manners, inviting rather than avoiding notice, of striking though not
    showy colours, the Mocking-bird would be sure to attract the attention
    of a stranger, even were he destitute of those unrivalled powers of
    song that have commanded the praise of all auditors. The faculty of
    imitating the voices of other birds, which has given to this species
    its ordinary appellation, has been ably described by Wilson and
    others, as well as the variety of notes, apparently original, which
    it commands. The former has often caused me no small disappointment;
    hearing the voice of, as I supposed, some new bird, or some that I
    was in want of, I have found, after creeping cautiously <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>and perhaps
    with some difficulty to the spot, that it proceeded from the familiar
    personage before us. With respect to the latter, I have been assured
    by an observant friend, George Marcy, Esq., of the Kepp, that he, on
    one occasion, counted no less than eighteen different notes, proceeding
    from a Mocking-bird perched on a tree in his garden.</p>

  <p>It is in the stillness of the night, when, like his European namesake,
    he delights</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“—— with wakeful melody to cheer</div>
        <div class="i1">The livelong hours,”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">that the song of this bird is heard to advantage. Sometimes, when,
    desirous of watching the first flight of <i>Urania Sloaneus</i>, I have
    ascended the mountains before break of day, I have been charmed with
    the rich gushes and bursts of melody proceeding from this most sweet
    songster, as he stood on tiptoe on the topmost twig of some sour-sop or
    orange tree, in the rays of the bright moonlight. Now he is answered
    by another, and now another joins the chorus, from the trees around,
    till the woods and savannas are ringing with the delightful sounds of
    exquisite and innocent joy. Nor is the season of song confined, as in
    many birds, to that period when courtship and incubation call forth
    the affections and sympathies of the sexes towards each other. The
    Mocking-bird is vocal at all seasons; and it is probably owing to his
    permanency of song, as well as to his incomparable variety, that the
    savannas and lowland groves of Jamaica are almost always alive with
    melody, though our singing birds are so few.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

  <p>“It is remarkable,” observes Mr. Hill, “that in those serenades and
    midnight solos, which have obtained for the Mocking-bird the name
    of the Nightingale, and which he commences with a rapid stammering
    prelude, as if he had awaked, frightened out of sleep, he never sings
    his songs of mimicry; his music at this time is his own. It is full of
    variety, with a fine compass, but less mingled and more equable than
    by day, as if the minstrel felt that the sober-seeming of the night
    required a solemnity of music peculiarly its own. The night-song of the
    Mocking-bird, though in many of its modulations it reminds us of that
    of the Nightingale of Europe, has less of volume in it. There is not
    more variety, but a less frequent repetition of those certain notes of
    extacy, which give such a peculiar character, and such wild, intense,
    and all absorbing feeling to the midnight song of the European bird.
    Though the more regulated quality of the song of <em>our</em> Nightingale
    is less calculated to create surprise, it is the more fitted to soothe
    and console; and that sensation of melancholy which is said to pervade
    the melody of the European minstrel, is substituted in the midnight
    singing of our bird by one of thoughtful and tranquil delight.”</p>

  <p>The nest of the Mocking-bird is not so elaborate a structure as that of
    many birds. It is built with little attempt at concealment in some bush
    or low tree, often an orange near the dwelling-house. One now before
    me, was built in a bunch of plantains. It consists of a rude platform
    of loose twigs, in which are interlaced many shreds of old rags;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
    this frame supports and encloses a rather neat cup, composed entirely
    of fine fibrous roots. Another has the frame almost wholly of rags,
    from canvas to lace; and the cup of thatch-threads, and horse-hair.
    Three eggs are commonly laid, measuring ¹⁹⁄₂₀ by ⁷⁄₁₀ inch, of a pale
    bluish-green, dashed with irregular blotches of pale reddish-brown:
    they are not perfectly regular in form, their oval having more or
    less tendency to a cylindrical shape, rather abruptly flattened at
    the ends. When young are in possession, their presence is no secret;
    for an unpleasant sound, half hissing, half whistling, is all day
    long issuing from their unfledged throats; delightful efforts, I dare
    say, to the fond parents. At this time the old birds are watchful and
    courageous. If an intruding boy or naturalist approaches their family,
    they hop from twig to twig, looking on with outstretched neck, in
    mute but evident solicitude; but any winged visitant, though ever so
    unconscious of evil intent, and though ever so large, is driven away
    with fearless pertinacity. The saucy Ani and Tinkling instantly yield
    the sacred neighbourhood, the brave Mocking-bird pursuing a group of
    three or four, even to several hundred yards’ distance; and even the
    John-crow, if he sail near the tree, is instantly attacked and driven
    from the scene. But the hogs are the creatures that give him the most
    annoyance. They are ordinarily fed upon the inferior oranges, the fruit
    being shaken down to them in the evenings; hence they acquire the
    habit of resorting to the orange-trees, to wait for a lucky windfall.
    The Mocking-bird feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> nettled at the intrusion, flies down and
    begins to peck the hog with all his might:—Piggy, not understanding the
    matter, but pleased with the titillation, gently lies down and turns
    up his broad side to enjoy it; the poor bird gets into an agony of
    distress, pecks and pecks again; but only increases the enjoyment of
    the luxurious intruder, and is at last compelled to give up the effort
    in despair.</p>

  <p>In St. Domingo the Mocking-bird is no less common than in Jamaica: it
    is there called by the French inhabitants Rosignol, which is but a
    modification of Rosignor, or lord of the rose, the Spanish name of the
    Nightingale, probably of Moorish origin.</p>

  <p>We have now arrived at an extensive group of birds of small size, and
    delicate form, mostly known by the name of <em>Warblers</em>. All of them
    are merely <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>winter visitants in Jamaica, the greater number retiring to
    the Northern continent to breed and spend the summer. To Wilson’s and
    Audubon’s descriptions, I refer the reader, as I have scarcely anything
    to add to their accounts of these birds.</p>

  <p>The Yellow-throat, one of the most beautiful of them, was first seen
    by me on the 8th of October, on which day I obtained two males, in
    distinct localities. I do not think the species had arrived long,
    though some of the <i>Sylvicolæ</i> had been with us nearly two months,
    for I and my servants were in the woods every day seeking for birds,
    and this species is too striking to be easily overlooked. In the latter
    autumn months it was quite common, particularly in marshy places: I
    have seen it in some numbers hopping busily about the bulrushes in a
    pond, even descending down the stems to the very surface of the water,
    and picking minute flies from thence. The stomachs of such as I have
    examined, contained fragments of beetles and other insects.</p>

  <p>In the spring, it seems to linger longer than its fellows; for the last
    warbler that I saw was of this species, on the 1st of May. Yet Wilson
    mentions that it habitually appears in Pennsylvania about the middle,
    or last week, of April; and that it begins to build its nest about the
    middle of May. The migration of the short-winged birds is probably
    performed in straggling parties, and extends over a considerable period
    of time; individuals remaining some time after the greater number have
    departed.</p>

  <p>This is a scarce bird with us. Some three or four specimens are all
    that have occurred to my observation. It seems, however, to spread
    rather widely over the diversities of mountain and lowland; for, while
    the first was obtained on the top of the Bluefields Peak, the next was
    found close to the sea-shore. Its habits are constant: for we have
    always observed it perched transversely on the dry trunks of slender
    dead trees, engaged in peeping into, and picking from, the crevices of
    the bark. In the stomachs of those which I have examined, I have found
    comminuted insects. Spiders and caterpillars form the chief portion of
    its food, according to Wilson.</p>

  <p>It is too rare to warrant an opinion as to the period of its arrival or
    departure: I first met with it on the 7th of October.</p>

  <p>I first saw this amusing species about the end of August, around
    the muddy margins of ponds in St. Elizabeth and Westmoreland; and
    immediately afterward they became so abundant, that individuals were to
    be seen running here and there on the road, all the way from Bluefields
    to Savanna-le-Mar, especially along the sea-shore, and by the edges
    of morasses; not at all associating, however. They run rapidly; often
    wade up to the heel in the water, or run along the twigs of a fallen
    tree at the brink, now and then flying up into the pimento and orange
    trees. When walking or standing, the tail is continually flirted up in
    the manner of the Wagtails, whence the local name of <em>Kick-up</em>,
    though, perhaps, none but a negro would consider a motion of the tail,
    <em>kicking</em>. The resemblance of this bird to the Wagtail, Wilson
    has noticed, and it is very striking in many respects. It walks among
    the low grass of pastures, picking here and there, wagging the tail,
    and uttering a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>sharp <em>chip</em>. Now and then it runs briskly, and
    snatches something, probably a winged insect, from the grass. Wilson
    praises its song very highly; in its winter residence with us it
    merely <em>chips</em> monotonously. The stomachs of several that I have
    dissected contained water-insects in fragments, and one or two small
    pond shells.</p>

  <p>There is a remarkable analogy in the Water Thrushes to the Snipes and
    Plovers, in their habits of running by the side of water, of wading,
    and of flirting up the hinder parts; in the height of the tarsi; and
    in the elongation of the tertials. The Pea-Dove, which frequents water
    more than any other of our Doves, has longer tertials than any. Is
    there any connexion between the lengthening of these feathers, and
    aquatic habits?</p>

  <p>The speckled breast, rich fulvous crown, and warm olive back, make this
    a very pretty bird. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>His manners are much like those of his cousin
    Bessy, running along with much wagging of the tail, and chirping
    <em>tsip, tsip</em>, incessantly. He is, however, less aquatic in
    his predilections. I first observed the species about the middle of
    September; it was on a low part of the road by the side of a morass.
    Its attitude struck me, as it was running on the ground with the
    tail held almost perpendicularly upwards. In the stomach, a muscular
    gizzard, I have occasionally found <em>various seeds</em>, gravel,
    mud-insects, caterpillars, and small turbinate shells. I was one day
    amused by watching two, unassociated, walking about a place covered
    with dry leaves, beneath some trees. I was unseen by them, though quite
    close. The tail of each was carried quite perpendicular as they walked,
    which gave a most grotesque effect; but, as if this elevation were not
    sufficient, at almost every step they jerked it up still higher, the
    white under-coverts projecting in a puffy globose form.</p>

  <p>Though this species arrives in Jamaica rather later than the preceding,
    they depart together, about the 20th of April: and soon after this
    their appearance in the United States is recorded. Unlike the
    preceding, the present species is said to be, even in summer, destitute
    of song.</p>

  <p>This pretty little species, so much in habits and appearance like the
    European Tits, arrives in Jamaica early in September, and retires
    late in April, for we last saw it on the 20th. During the autumn and
    winter it was among the most common of our warblers. In the morasses,
    especially, they were to be seen in numbers, yet not in company, making
    the sombre mangrove-woods lively, if not vocal. They are active and
    restless, hopping perpendicularly up the slender boles, and about the
    twigs, peeping into the bases of the leaves, and crevices of the bark,
    for insects.</p>

  <p>The female, identified by dissection, has all the colours paler, but
    agrees with the male in their variety and distribution. Individuals,
    however, were found in September, which had the blue plumage of the
    head and of the rump, tipped with yellow, imparting a green tinge to
    those parts.</p>

  <p>I have little to say of this changeable species. It occurs but
    sparsely with us, coming rather late in the autumn, when the plumage
    is undergoing its transformation, so well detailed by Wilson. On only
    one occasion have I observed them numerous; towards the latter part of
    March, on the estate called Dawkins’ Saltpond, near Spanish town, many
    were hopping about the Cashaw trees (<i>Prosopis juliflora</i>) that
    abound there. All of these that I examined, had the yellow of the crown
    obscured, and some almost obliterated. One which I shot in October did
    not display it at all, while one in January had the hue very brilliant,
    but only at the bases of the coronal feathers; exposed or concealed as
    in some of the Tyrants. As far as I have observed, the manners of this
    bird are those of a Flycatcher, capturing minute insects on the wing,
    and returning to a twig to eat them. The stomach is usually filled with
    a black mass of minute flies.</p>

  <p>Wilson has justly observed that the habits of this lovely bird are
    those of a Tit or a Creeper. I have usually observed it creeping about
    the twigs of trees, or among the blossoms. The first I met with was
    thus engaged, creeping in and out, and clinging to the beautiful and
    fragrant flowers that grew in profuse spikes from the summit of a
    papaw-tree. It is one of the earliest of our visitors from the north,
    for this was on the 16th of August; and it remains until April among
    the sunny glades of our magnificent island. The stomach of such as I
    have examined was large, and contained caterpillars of various sizes
    and species. An individual in March, which I proved by dissection to
    be a female, did not differ in intensity of colouring, or any other
    appreciable respect, from the male. The eggs in the ovary at that
    season, were distinguishable, but minute.</p>

  <p>Of this very beautiful species, which has been described under so
    many names, I have specimens in much diversity of plumage, from that
    in which the chestnut crown, and spots of the breast are deep and
    conspicuous, to that in which there is no trace either of the one or
    the other. There is little in their manners to distinguish them from
    others of this pretty family. They arrive in Jamaica in September, and
    depart in April; and, like their fellows, hop about low trees, feeding
    on small insects. In March, I observed it rather numerous, hopping
    about the <i>Cleome pentaphylla</i>, and other low shrubs which were
    then in flower, on the banks of the new cut of the Rio Cobre, not half
    a mile from the sea of Kingston Harbour. Whenever I have seen it, it
    has been very near the sea.</p>

  <p>The pair of singularly marked Warblers which I describe below, were

    summer plumage would be much more brilliant than my specimen, I have
    no doubt, for the latter is inferior to the female, and the patched
    character of the plumage indicates that a seasonal change was then
    proceeding. If it has been described in its nuptial livery I have
    failed to recognise it. The male, which was the first obtained, was
    hopping about the mangroves, which are abundant at the marshy place
    named, from the summits down to the very surface of the water; and
    the female was one of a pair that were toying, and chasing each other
    through the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>branches of the same trees. At this time, the ovary was
    scarcely developed, the ova being distinguishable only with a lens. The
    stomach, in each case, was filled with a black mass of insects.</p>

  <p>It is before the fierce heat of summer has begun to abate in the
    prairies of the west, that this little bird seeks its winter quarters.
    On the 18th of August I first met with it, on which day I shot two in
    different localities. One was hopping hurriedly about low bushes, and
    herbaceous weeds, not a foot from the ground, examining every stalk
    and twig, as it proceeded regularly but rapidly along the road-side,
    for insects. The other was differently engaged. It flew from a bush by
    the way-side as far as the middle of the road, when hovering in the
    air a few feet from the ground, it fluttered and turned hither and
    thither, and then flew back to nearly the same spot as that whence it
    had started. In a second or two it performed exactly the same manœuvres
    again; and then a third time, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>preventing, by the irregularity of its
    contortions, my taking aim at it, for some time. I have no doubt it was
    capturing some of the minute dipterous flies which were floating in the
    declining sun, in numerous swarms; but in a manner not usual with the
    Warblers. The stomach, in each specimen, was full of small fragments of
    insects. From that period to April, on the 11th of which month I last
    saw it, it was a very common resident in the bushes and low woods.</p>

  <p>Wilson describes the markings of the female as less vivid than those
    of the male; but two of that sex, which I shot in January, were in no
    respect inferior to the brightest males. Some have the red spots of
    the back almost, or even quite, obliterated; but this is not a sexual
    distinction.</p>

  <p>In its winter residence with us, the Black-throat prefers the edges of
    tall woods, in unfrequented mountainous localities. I have scarcely met
    with it in the lowlands. The summits of Bluefields Peaks, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>Bognie and
    Rotherwood, are where I have been familiar with it. It was there that
    Sam shot the first specimen that I obtained, on the 7th of October,
    and at the same lofty elevation. I afterwards saw it repeatedly. Three
    or four of these lovely birds frequently play together with much
    spirit, for half an hour at a time, chasing each other swiftly round
    and round, occasionally dodging through the bushes, and uttering, at
    intervals, a pebbly <em>chip</em>. They often alight, but are no sooner
    on the twig than off, so that it is difficult to shoot them. I have
    observed one peck a glass-eye berry, and in the stomachs of more than
    one, I have observed many hard shining black seeds. But more frequently
    it leaps up at flies and returns to a twig. At other times I have
    noticed it flitting and turning about in the woods, apparently pursuing
    insects, and suddenly drop perpendicularly fifteen or twenty feet,
    to the ground, and there hop about. Restlessness is its character:
    often it alights transversely on the long pendent vines and withes,
    or on slender dry trees, hopping up and down them without a moment’s
    intermission, pecking at insects. It is generally excessively fat, and
    what is rather unusual, the fat is as white as that of mutton.</p>

  <p>In the middle of March I met with it in the neighbourhood of Spanish
    town, and, on the 9th of April, Sam found it at Crabpond, for the
    last time, soon after which it, no doubt, deserted its insular for a
    continental residence.</p>

  <p>The form of the beak as well as the habits, of this bird, indicate an
    approach to the Flycatchers.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

  <p>In the Ornithology of M. Ramon de la Sagra’s Cuba, this species is
    figured, under the name of Bijirita, which, however, appears to
    be common to the Warblers. “Though migratory, it seems to breed
    occasionally in the Antilles, for M. de la Sagra has killed in Cuba,
    young ones, which were doubtless hatched in the island.”</p>

      purplish horn, with pale soles. Head, neck, back, less coverts, chin,
      throat and breast, mottled with black and white, each feather being
      grey at the base, and black, bounded on each side by white, at the tip.
      The black preponderates on the upper parts, the white on the breast,
      where the black spots take arrow-headed forms. Wing-quills and coverts
      black; the first primaries have the middle portion of their outer edge
      narrowly white, and those from the third to the seventh inclusive have
      a more conspicuous white spot at the basal part of the outer edge. The
      secondary greater coverts are tipped outwardly with white, the medial
      coverts more broadly; and these form two bands, but not very notable.
      Plumage of rump and tail-coverts unwebbed, brownish-grey. Tail-feathers
      black, with paler edges, the outmost two or three tipped inwardly with
      white. Sides, thighs, and under tail-coverts grey, with indistinct
      black centres. Belly greyish white.
  </div>

  <p>This is another species, of which I have but a single specimen. It was
    shot on the 9th of February, in Bognie woods, on the top of Bluefields
    Peak. I know nothing of its manners, but that it was engaged, as
    Warblers commonly are, hopping on trees, and peeping for insects. The
    specimen was a male. Its general aspect is like that of the Black and
    white Creeper, but it may be distinguished at once by comparison;
    the colours in <em>that</em> being distributed in greater masses, and
    disposed in broad stripes; in <em>this</em>, in small mottlings, or thick
    spotting, which difference is especially observable on the head. The
    beak, also, though partly shot away in my specimen, is decidedly that
    of a <i>Sylvicola</i>.</p>

  <p>The great family of Flycatchers are distinguished by their depressed
    beak and rictal bristles, and by their general habit of capturing
    flying insects on the wing, and returning to a resting place to
    swallow them. The species, before us, however, a bird of remarkable
    elegance, both of form and colour,—combines with this habit, those of
    the Warblers; Wilson’s assertion to the contrary notwithstanding. It
    is particularly restless, hopping from one twig to another through a
    wood, so rapidly, that it is difficult to keep it in sight, though
    conspicuous from its brilliant contrast of colours; yet it is not a
    shy bird. A good deal of its insect food it obtains by picking it from
    the twigs and flowers. About the end of the year, a male was in the
    habit of frequenting the lawn of Bluefields House, day after day. In
    the early morning, while the grass was yet wet with dews, it might be
    seen running on the ground, at which time its long tail being raised
    at a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>small angle, and the fore parts of its body depressed, it had
    much of the aspect of a Wagtail. It ran with great swiftness hither
    and thither, a few feet at a time, and during each run, the wings were
    opened and vibrated in a peculiar flutter with great rapidity. It was,
    I am sure, taking small insects, as now and then it turned short.
    Sometimes, instead of running, it took a short flight, but still close
    to the turf.</p>

  <p>One which was wounded in the wing, I put into a cage; on the floor of
    which it sat, looking wildly upwards, the beautiful tail being expanded
    like a fan, so as to display the orange-colour on each side. All the
    while it chirped pertinaciously, producing the sharp sound of two
    quartz pebbles struck together.</p>

  <p>This was the very first of the migrant visitors from the North that I
    met with, a female having been killed in the mountains of St. Elizabeth
    as early as the 10th of August. We lost sight of it again about the
    20th of April; so that this species remains in the islands upwards of
    eight months. Yet nearly four weeks before this, I observed a pair
    engaged in amatory toying, pursuing each other to and fro among the
    pimento trees.</p>

  <p>On the 8th of May, 1838, being at sea in the Gulf of Mexico, not far
    from the Dry Tortugas, a young male of this lovely species flew on
    board. It would fly from side to side, and from rope to rope, as if
    unwilling to leave the vessel, but occasionally it would stretch off to
    a long distance, then turn round, and fly straight back again; it was
    not at all exhausted. While I held it, it squeaked and bit at my hand
    violently and fiercely.</p>

      emarginated. Throat ashy, tinged with yellow. Breast, belly, sides, and
      under tail-coverts, yellowish-brown. Under wing-coverts dull-buff.
  </div>

  <p>There is much resemblance between this species and the <i>Tyrannula
    megacephala</i> of Swainson’s Birds of Brazil, pl. 47; but they are
    manifestly distinct.</p>

  <p>In unfrequented mountain roads, bordered by deep forests, the Flat-bill
    is very common, and from its fearlessness easily obtained. In the
    autumn months, the traveller may observe a dozen or more in the course
    of a mile, sitting on the projecting branches of the way-side woods.
    There is, however, nothing like association of one with another; like
    the other Tyrants, it is quite solitary, at least in its occupation.
    It flies very little, the wings being short and hollow; but sits on
    a twig, and leaps out at vagrant flies, which it catches with a loud
    snap, and returns; it utters a feeble squeak as it sits. Sometimes it
    emits a weak wailing cry, as, it flits from one tree to another.</p>

  <p>The analogies often observed between animals <span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>possessing no affinity,
    is curious. The flat, weak bill, darker above than below, the general
    form, the hollow wings, the loose plumage, and the habit of sitting on
    a low twig unmoved by the presence of man, this species possesses in
    common with the Tody.</p>

      softening on the back to a paler hue, slightly tinged with olive;
      tail-coverts dark umber. Wings black; greater and mid coverts, and
      secondaries edged with pale umber; the tertials have still paler edges.
      Tail smoky black, each feather narrowly edged with umber. Sides of head
      and neck, pale bistre. Chin, throat, and fore neck, ashy-grey, blending
      on the breast with the pure straw-yellow, which is the hue of the
      belly, sides, vent, and under tail-coverts. Edge of shoulder pale buff.
  </div>

  <p>A very common species, frequenting the edges of high woods and
    road-sides, like the preceding, the manners of these birds being
    nearly the same. It is a skilful fly-catcher, and a voracious one. I
    have taken a <i>Libellula</i> of considerable size from the stomach
    of one, which not only filled that organ, but extended through the
    proventriculus to the œsophagus: the head was downward, which position
    was of course the most favourable for being swallowed.</p>

  <p>When taken in the hand, it erects the crown-feathers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> and snaps the
    beak loudly and often, uttering shrill squeaks also, at intervals.
    Its note is one of the very earliest; even before the light of day
    has begun to dim the brilliancy of the morning star, this little bird
    is vocal. A single wailing note, somewhat protracted, is his ordinary
    voice, particularly sad to hear, but sometimes followed by one or two
    short notes in another tone.</p>

  <p>I have never met with the nest of either this or the preceding species,
    but Robinson (MSS. ii. 98,) describing this bird as “the Lesser
    Loggerhead of Jamaica,” says, “they have three young, generally reared
    in any hollow place of a tree in June.” He adds, “they have no note;”
    but in this he was in error.</p>

  <p>For a time I considered this to be the Pewee of Wilson, but its
    superior size, grey throat, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>rufous edges of the wing and tail,
    have convinced me that it is quite distinct. I have little information
    to give concerning it that would distinguish it from the other Tyrants.
    It resides in Jamaica permanently, and is of rather common occurrence,
    at the edges of woods; it manifests, perhaps, less fear of man than
    even its congeners, often pursuing its employment of catching insects
    though a person stand beneath the twig which it has chosen as a
    station. If it does remove it usually perches again a few yards off,
    and sits looking at the stranger.</p>

  <p>I have not found its nest; but near the end of August, I met some negro
    boys who had three young ones of this species, which they had just
    taken from the nest, situated, as they described, in a hollow stump.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The history of this bird shall be mainly told by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>my valued friend
    Mr. Hill. “It is along the sea-side savannas and pastures, and among
    the adjacent hills and valleys, that the migratory flocks of the Grey
    Petchary swarm at the beginning of September. Occasional showers have
    given a partial freshness to the lowland landscape; the fields have
    begun to look grassy and green, and the trees to brighten with verdure,
    when numbers of these birds appear congregated on the trees around the
    cattle ponds, and about the open meadows, hawking the insect-swarms
    that fill the air at sun-down. No sooner do the migrant visitors appear
    on our shores, than the several birds of the species, that breed with
    us, quit their nestling trees, and disappear from their customary beat.
    They join the stranger flocks, and gather about the places to which the
    migratory visitors resort, and never resume their ordinary abodes till
    the breeding season returns.</p>

  <p>The migrant visitors do not appear among us many days before they
    become exceedingly fat: they are then eagerly sought after by the
    sportsman, who follows the flocks to their favourite haunts, and
    slaughters them by dozens. The Petchary is not exclusively an
    insect-feeder;—the sweet wild berries tempt him. In September the
    pimenta begins to fill and ripen, and in these groves the birds may
    always be found, not so much gathered in flocks as thickly dispersed
    about. It is, however, at sunset that they exclusively congregate;
    when insect life is busiest on the wing. Wherever the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>stirring swarms
    abound, they may be seen ranged in dense lines on the bare branch of
    some advantageous tree. By the end of September, the migrant Petcharies
    quit us, leaving with us most of those which bred with us.”</p>

  <p>“The Petchary is among the earliest breeders of the year. As
    early as the month of January the mated pairs are already in
    possession of some lofty and commanding tree, sounding at
    day-dawn that ceaseless shriek, composed of a repetition of
    some three or four shrill notes, very similar to the words
    <i>pecheery—pecheery—pe-chēēr-ry</i>, from which they
    receive their name. To this locality they remain constant till
    the autumn. They then quit these haunts, and congregate about the
    lowland ponds. At some hour or two before sunset, they assemble in
    considerable numbers to prey upon the insects that hover about these
    watering-places. They are then observed unceasingly winging upward and
    downward, and athwart the waters, twittering and shrieking, but never
    flying far. They dart off from some exposed twig, where they had sat
    eight or ten in a row, and return to it again, devouring there, the
    prey they have caught. Their evolutions are rapid; their positions of
    flight are constantly and hurriedly changing; they shew at one while
    all the outer, and at another all the inner plumage; and they fly,
    checking their speed suddenly, and turning at the smallest imaginable
    angle. There are times when the Petchary starts off in a straight line
    from his perch, and glides with motionless wings, as light and buoyant
    as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> gossamer, from one tree to another. When he descends to pick an
    insect from the surface of the water, his downward course is as if he
    were tumbling, and when he rises in a line upward, he ascends with a
    curious lift of the wings, as if he were thrown up in the air, and were
    endeavouring to recover himself from the impetus.</p>

  <p>“The congregated flocks disappear entirely before the month of October
    is out. It is only in some five or six weeks of the year that they
    are reconciled to association in communities. At all other times they
    restrict their company to their mates, and permit no other bird to
    divide with them their solitary trees.</p>

  <p>“From the window of the room in which I am writing, I look out upon a
    very lofty cocoa-nut tree, in the possession of a pair of Petcharies.
    Long before the voice of any other bird is heard in the morning, even
    when daylight is but faintly gleaming, the shrill unvarying cry of
    these birds is reiterated from their aerie on the tree-top. Perched on
    this vantage-height, they scream defiance to every inhabitant around
    them, and sally forth to wage war on all the birds that venture near.
    None but the Swallow dares to take the circuit of their nestling tree.
    At a signal from one of the birds, perhaps the female, when a Carrion
    Vulture is sweeping near, or a Hawk is approaching, the mate flings
    himself upwards in the air, and having gained an elevation equal to
    that of the bird he intends to attack, he starts off in a horizontal
    line, with nicely balanced wings, and hovering for a moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span> descends
    upon the intruder’s back, shrieking all the while, as he sinks and
    rises, and repeats his attacks with vehemence. The Carrion Vulture,
    that seldom courses the air but with gliding motion now flaps his wings
    eagerly, and pitches downward at every stroke his assailant makes at
    him, and tries to dodge him. In this way he pursues him, and frequently
    brings him to the ground.</p>

  <p>“The Hawk is beset by all birds of any power of wing, but the boldest,
    and, judging from the continued exertion he makes to escape, the most
    effective of his assailants is the Petchary. It is not with feelings of
    contempt the Hawk regards this foe:—he hurries away from him with rapid
    flight, and hastily seeks to gain some resting place; but as he takes
    a direct course from one exposed tree to another equally ill-suited,
    he is seen again submitting to the infliction of a renewed visit from
    his pertinacious assailant, till he is constrained to soar upward, and
    speed away, wearied by the buffets of his adversary.</p>

  <p>“The appearance of the Petchary, when he erects the feathers of his
    crest, or opens those of his forehead, and shews glimpses of his fiery
    crown is fierce, vindictive, and desperate. His eye is deeply dark,
    and his bill, although it greatly resembles, in its robust make, that
    of the Raven, is even of sturdier proportions than that bird’s; the
    bristles are black, and amazingly strong.</p>

  <p>“The Petchary has been known to make prey of the Humming-bird, as it
    hovers over the blossom of the garden. When he seizes it, he kills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> it
    by repeated blows, struck on the branch where he devours it. I have
    remarked him, beside, beating over little spaces of a field, like a
    Hawk, and reconnoitring the flowers beneath him; searching also along
    the blossoms of a hedge-bank, and striking so violently into the
    herbage for insects, that he has been turned over as he grabbed his
    prey, and seemed saved from breaking his neck in his vehemence, only by
    the recoil of the herbage.</p>

  <p>“His nest in this part of the island has seldom been found in any other
    trees than those of the palm-kind. Amid the web of fibres that encircle
    the footstalk of each branch of the cocoa-nut, he weaves a nest, lined
    with cotton, wool, and grass. The eggs are four or five, of an ivory
    colour, blotched with deep purple spots, intermingled with brown
    specks, with the clusters thickening at the greater end. The Eagle,
    flapping his pinions as he shrieks from his rock when the tempest-cloud
    passes by, is not a more striking picture than this little bird, when,
    with his anxieties all centred in the cradle of his young ones, he
    stands in ‘his pride of place,’ on the limb of his palm, towering high
    above all other trees, and battling with the breeze that rocks it, and,
    rush after rush as the wind sweeps onward, flutters his wings with
    every jerk of the branches, and screams like a fury.”</p>

  <p>I have little to add to the above detail. With us at the western end
    of the Island, the Grey Petchary is wholly migratory, not one having
    been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span> seen by us from October to April. If its migrations be, as I
    have reason to think, not northward and southward, but eastward and
    westward, this fact is easily accounted for, from the greater nearness
    of our part to Central America, where they probably winter. This
    species is found in St. Domingo, but not, as it appears, in Cuba, where
    it seems to be represented by <i>T. Magnirostris</i>, D’Orb., nor
    has it been recognised, except accidentally, in North America. Even
    its wintering about Spanish Town, seems to be not constant, for from
    communications made to me by Mr. Hill, the present spring, I infer none
    had been seen through the winter. In Westmoreland, I observed the first
    individual after the winter, on the 30th of March, at the Short Cut of
    Paradise-morass; and a day or two afterwards they were numerous there,
    and were advancing to the eastward. Yet on the 16th of April, Mr. Hill
    writes me, “It is worth remarking that, although Grey Petcharies have
    been several days now with you, they have not made their appearance
    here yet.” He adds the interesting note, afforded by some friends who
    had in March visited the Pedro kays, that “the Grey Petchary, was seen
    making its traverse by those rocks,” and that “the migratory birds that
    visited those islets came from the west and departed to the eastward,
    or, as it was otherwise expressed, they came from the Indian coast,
    and proceeded on to the coast of Jamaica, coursing from southward and
    westward to northward and eastward.” The dispersion of the arrived
    migrants along the groves of Jamaica,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> seems to be very leisurely, for
    a month after their appearance with us, Mr. Hill writes, on the 28th
    of April, “This morning the Grey Petchary made his appearance on the
    lofty cocoa-nut, <em>for the first time this season</em>. He is there
    now, shivering his wings, on its flaunting limbs, unceasingly screaming
    <em>pi-chee-ree-e</em>. He is turning about and proclaiming his arrival
    to every quarter of the wind. He is Sir Oracle, and no dog must bark in
    his neighbourhood.”</p>

  <p>I have not observed in the vicinity of Bluefields, the predilection
    alluded to by my friend of this bird for the Palm-tribe. Several pairs
    have nested under my notice, but none of them were in palm-trees. Of
    two which I procured for examination, one was from an upper limb of a
    bitterwood-tree, of no great height, close to a friend’s door. It was
    a cup made of the stalks and tendrils of either a small passion-flower
    or a bryony, the spiral tendrils prettily arranged round the edge, and
    was very neatly and thickly lined with black horse-hair. It contained
    three young, newly hatched, and thinly clothed with a buff-coloured
    down, and one egg. The other was from a hog-plum (<i>Spondias</i>).
    It was a rather loose structure, smaller and less compact, composed
    almost entirely of tendrils, which gave it a crisped appearance; a few
    stalks entered into the frame, but there was no horse-hair within; but
    one or two of the shining black frond-ribs of a fern, scarcely thicker
    than hair. The eggs, three in number, were round-oval, 1 inch by &#190;;
    dull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span> reddish-white, handsomely marked with spots and angular clouds of
    red-brown, much resembling the sinuous outline of land on a terrestrial
    globe.</p>

  <p>D’Orbigny in the Ornithology of Ramon de la Sagra’s work on Cuba,
    has described and figured this species, which in its appearance and
    manners very much resembles the King-bird of the United States, as
    it does also the preceding species. It is, however, a permanent
    inhabitant of Jamaica. In Westmoreland and St. Elizabeth’s, the name
    Petchary is applied indifferently to this and the grey species, as the
    equivalent term <em>Pitirre</em>, in Cuba seems to indicate any species
    of <i>Tyrannus</i>. Vieillot has described a closely allied bird,
    if not identical with ours, by the name of <i>Tyr. Pipiri</i>. But
    in the neighbourhood of Spanish Town, this species is distinguished
    from the grey, to which the name Petchary is there confined, by the
    term Loggerhead, which, with us to leeward, is applied to the rufous
    species, <i>T. Crinitus</i>. It is well to be aware of this confusion
    of local names, or we may <span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>be liable to predicate of one species, what
    is true only of another.</p>

  <p>It is one of the commonest birds of Jamaica, both in the lowlands
    and the hilly districts, nor is it rare even at the elevation of the
    Bluefields Peaks. It seems to delight in the fruit and timber-trees,
    which are thickly planted in the pens, and around the homesteads
    of the southern coast, and everywhere, in fact, where insects are
    numerous. The larger kinds of insects form the prey of this species as
    of the former. I have seen one pursue with several doublings a large
    <i>Cetonia</i>, which, however, having escaped, the bird instantly
    snapped up a <i>Cicada</i> of still greater bulk, and began to beat
    it to kill it, while the poor insect sung shrilly as it was being
    devoured. It frequently resorts to a tree that overhangs still water,
    for the purpose of hawking after the dragon-flies that skim over the
    surface. The size of these insects, and their projecting wings, would
    seem to make the swallowing of them a matter of some difficulty; for
    I have noticed that the bird jerks the insect round by little and
    little, without letting it go, till the head points inward, when it is
    swallowed more readily. Mr. Hill has noticed a very interesting trait
    in this bird, so frequently as to be properly called a habit. It will
    play with a large beetle as a cat with a mouse, no doubt after its
    appetite has been sated. Sitting on a twig, and holding the beetle in
    its beak, it suddenly permits it to drop, then plunging downward, it
    gets beneath the insect before it has had time to reach the ground,
    and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span> turning upward catches it as it falls. It sometimes continues this
    sport a quarter of an hour.</p>

  <p>In the winter season, the seeds of the Tropic-birch (<i>Bursera</i>)
    appear to constitute a large portion of the food of our Tyrannidæ. One
    day in January, I observed two Petcharies on a birch-tree, fluttering
    in an unusual manner, and stood to watch their proceedings. I found
    they were feeding on the ripe berries, which they plucked off in a
    singular manner. Each bird sitting on a twig, seized a berry in his
    beak, then throwing back his head till he was in a perpendicular
    position, tugged till the stalk gave way, his wings being expanded, and
    vibrated all the while to prevent him from falling. Yet, even at this
    season, they contrive to fill their craws with insects; for one which
    I dissected the next day, had its stomach filled with hymenoptera and
    coleoptera, among which were the fragments of a most brilliant little
    <i>Buprestis</i>, the possession of which I envied it. I observed that
    the stomach was protuberant below the sternum, as in the cuckoos. At
    this early season, the time of incubation was near; for the ovary of
    this specimen contained an egg as large as a small marble; and my
    lad who shot it, told me that this one and its mate were toying and
    pursuing each other around a tall manchioneel-tree, on one of whose
    upper limbs he discovered a nest nearly finished.</p>

  <p>The nest consists of a loose basket of dry stems of yam, and tendrils
    of passion-flower, lined with a slight cup of horse-hair and fibres
    from palmetto-leaves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span> Four or five eggs are laid, of a drab hue or
    reddish-white, with blotches of reddish-brown and bluish irregularly
    intermixed, but chiefly arranged in the form of a crown around the
    larger end.</p>

  <p>In the month of September they become, in common with their grey
    congeners, a mere mass of fat, and are at this time in much request
    for the table. They are supposed to acquire this fatness by feeding on
    the honey-bees, which then resort in great numbers to the magnificent
    bloom-spike of the cabbage-palm. Hither the Petchary also resorts, and
    sitting on a frond captures the industrious insects as they approach.
    At this time the large and branching spike of blossom, projecting
    and then curving gracefully downwards, and looking as if exquisitely
    moulded in white wax, is a very beautiful object; and the pollen from
    the flowers is diffused so abundantly, that the ground beneath the
    tree, appears exactly as if it had been visited by a snow-shower.</p>

  <p>This appears to be the species alluded to by Robinson in the following
    note. “They [the Tyrants, <i>Baristi</i>, as he calls them,] are all
    very bold birds, especially the largest species called the Loggerhead,
    who beats all kinds of birds indiscriminately; he is also the harbinger
    of the morning, constantly giving notice of the approach of day by
    his cry. When he is beating a Carrion Crow or other birds, he snaps
    his bill very frequently; he is a very active, bold bird, and feeds
    upon insects and lizards. I have seen him give chase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> to a lizard
    round the trunk of a small tree, flying in circles with surprising
    activity. In beating any large bird, both cock and hen (if both are
    in the way,) join in the quarrel or scuffle.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In these assaults,
    the intrepid Petchary does not <em>always</em> come off scathless.
    “And here,” says Robinson in speaking of the Red-tailed Buzzard, “I
    cannot help recollecting an unhappy though deserved ill-fate, which
    sometimes befalls the large Loggerhead. Everybody is acquainted with
    the pugnacious nature of this little bird; for he attacks and buffets
    every large bird that happens to fall in his way, snapping his beak and
    pursuing him with great violence; and among others this great Hawk is
    often disturbed and beaten by him.</p>

  <p>“At Chestervale, in the cultivated ground, it is common for this Hawk
    to perch upon the top of some dry tree. This situation he chooses that
    he may the better view the ground beneath, and observe if a rat or
    other animal should make its appearance. While he sits here upon the
    watch, ’tis ten to one but he is attacked by the Loggerhead, whom he
    suffers to buffet and beat him with great patience, without offering
    to stir once from his place; till, his assailant being quite tired
    and spent with the violence of his exercise, inadvertently sits down
    on some twig not far distant from his passive, and, as he may think,
    inoffensive enemy. That enemy, however, now keeps his eye fixed on him,
    and no sooner does he begin to preen his feathers, or look carelessly
    about him, than <span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>down pounces the Hawk suddenly upon him, seizes the
    unwary bird in his talons, and devours him.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

  <p>The courage of the Tyrants in defence of their nests, is well known;
    but it seems at times to become almost a mania. The late proprietor of
    Mount Airy, in his daily walks about the estate, was attacked with such
    virulence by a Petchary that was nesting, the bird actually pecking his
    head, that he was compelled to take out a stick in defence, with which
    he at length struck down the too valiant bird. Dogs seem especially
    obnoxious to it, and this not only during incubation; at any time a
    passing dog is likely to be assaulted by this fierce bird, and if he
    be so unfortunate as to have any sore on his body, that is sure to be
    the point of attack. One of my youths, a veracious lad, narrated to me
    the following circumstance, to which he was witness. A large dog was
    following his mistress through Mount Edgecumbe Pen, when a Petchary
    flew virulently at him: on the shoulder of the dog was a large running
    sore; to this the bird directed his attention: suspending himself
    over the wound, he clutched with his extended feet as if he wished to
    seize it thus, snapping angrily with his beak; then suddenly he pecked
    the wound, while the dog howled in agony. The bird, however, repeated
    its assaults exactly in the same manner, until the blood ran down the
    shoulder from the wound; the dog all the while seemingly cowed and
    afraid to run, but howling most piteously, and turning round to snap at
    the bird. The woman was at some distance <span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>ahead, and took no notice;
    and the war continued until my informant left. The Petchary continued,
    in this case, on the wing; but frequently he alights on the dog to peck
    him.</p>

  <p>Both this and the Grey Petchary, when excited, open and shut the
    coronal feathers alternately. When opened, the appearance is as if a
    deep furrow had been ploughed through the plumage of the head, the
    sides of which are vividly coloured. Occasionally this furrow is
    opened in death, and remains so: one or two birds being brought me in
    this condition, when my acquaintance with the species was slight, I
    suspected that some of the feathers had been plucked out, in order to
    enhance the value of the specimens by displaying the gayer colour. A
    male of the present species, which I wounded one day in April, on my
    taking it up, began to scream passionately, and to open and shut the
    crown, biting ferociously; another from the same tree, probably his
    mate, attracted by his cries, pursued me, endeavouring to peck me:
    and when repelled, continued to gaze, stretching its neck anxiously,
    whenever the screams were repeated.</p>

  <p>In the quotation from Robinson’s MSS., page 180, the early habits of
    this bird were noticed. On the same subject, Mr. Hill writes me, “I
    know no bird-voice, not excepting ‘the cock’s shrill clarion,’ that is
    earlier heard than the <em>pi-pi-pihou</em> of the Loggerhead Tyrant.
    In my neighbourhood several of the yards are planted with cocoa-nut
    trees. On a very lofty cocoa palm to the north of me, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span> pair of Grey
    Petcharies annually nestle in the month of April. On half a dozen
    less elevated ones to the west of me, several Loggerheads take up
    their locations as early as January, and build their nests there.
    I say January, as that is their time for nestling, but I see them
    there ordinarily by Christmas, and I hear the clang and clatter of
    their voices before; but it is not till the turn of the year, that
    they unfailingly chant every morning their peculiar reveillé; singing
    <em>pi-pi-pihou, pi-pi—, pipi-pi-pihou</em>, for an hour
    from the firing of the Port Royal gun, a little before five, till the
    sun is well up:—they then descend to some of the lower vegetation round
    about, and alter their chant from the more musical <em>pipi-pihou</em>,
    to a sort of scream of <em>pi-i-i-i-i-hou</em>, for the space of
    about twenty minutes more; when they cease for the day. It was this
    remarkable obtrusion of their chant upon the ear, before day-break, in
    the shortest of our days, that led me to the conclusion that they were
    the <i>Tyrannus matutinus</i> of Vieillot. Buffon, on remarking that
    no bird is earlier than the Black-headed Pipiri, as he designates it,
    for he is assured that it is heard as soon as the day begins to dawn,
    gives two or three striking notes from St. Domingo correspondents,
    in which this fact is particularly recorded. A Mr. Deshayes in his
    communication writes, that “the Pipiri seen in the forest, and in
    ruinate lands, and in cultivated spots, thrives everywhere; but more
    especially the Yellow-crested Pipiri, which is the more multiplied
    species; that one delights in places that are inhabited. In winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
    they draw near to houses, and as the temperature of this season in
    these climates, has much the character of spring-time in France, it
    would seem that the prevailing coolness and freshness fills them with
    life and gaiety. Indeed never are they seen so full of clatter, and so
    cheerful as in the months of November and December; they then tease
    each other, and dash along somersetting (<i>voltigent</i>) one after
    the other, as a sort of prelude to love-making.’” My friend again
    writes me on the 30th of April:—“As I lay fever-wake on the morning of
    the 27th, I heard again the Loggerhead Tyrant singing most musically
    his day-dawn salutation of <em>pipi-pihou</em>. My sister, who listened
    to the early songster too, thinks that <span class="smcap">op</span>, <span class="smcap">pp</span>,
    <span class="smcap">p</span>, <span class="smcap">q</span>, is his morning lesson; and it is, perhaps, the
    closest resemblance to his chant. He is a scholar after the fashion
    of modern Infant schools. His alphabet and multiplication-table are a
    song. He repeated his lesson the following morning, but I have slept so
    soundly since, that I cannot say whether he has continued to wake to
    his learning at the firing of the Port Royal gun.”</p>

  <p>Though found in Jamaica through the winter, the Loggerhead is not then
    very common; but in March many begin to frequent the groves, and trees
    of the pastures; and may be observed pursuing each other in devious
    flights, uttering a rattling cry, harsh, though not loud. As they sit
    in a tree, they emit at intervals a loud <em>pirr</em>, in a plaintive
    tone, ruffling the plumage, and shivering the wings at the same time.
    Its general habits are those of its congeners, but it lacks their
    pugnacity. Very large insects form its ordinary prey: one I shot in the
    very act of taking a large <em>cicada</em>, while sitting on a twig, the
    insect was still in its throat when killed. In November I have found

  <p>This species, hitherto undescribed, is named and figured by Mr. G. R.
    Gray, in his “Genera of Birds,” from specimens procured by myself. It
    is not uncommon in the mountain districts of Jamaica, where, from the
    remarkable diversity in the appearance of the male and female, they
    are distinguished by separate local names. The black male is known by
    the feminine appellation of Judy, while the chestnut-headed female
    receives the masculine soubriquet of Mountain Dick. Mr. Gray, from
    his acquaintance with the genus, I presume, was able to identify the
    sexes by an examination of dried skins, while I was long in coming to
    the same conclusion, from observation of the living birds. Yet I early
    suspected it; their form and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>size were the same; their manners were
    the same; their singular call was the same; they were almost always
    found either actually in company, or else the one calling, and the
    other answering, at a short distance from each other. It remained,
    however, to prove the fact; and I accordingly dissected every specimen
    that fell in my way, for many months; the result of which was that
    every “Judy,” was a male; and that almost every “Mountain Dick” was
    a female; to this latter there were but two exceptions; two in the
    umber plumage were indubitably males, but in one of them, shot in
    February, the dark brown hue of the head was almost obliterated, and
    replaced by black, the tips and edges only of the feathers being brown.
    Probably, the male of the first year bears the colours of the female, a
    supposition afterwards confirmed.</p>

  <p>Though more frequently seen at a considerable elevation from the sea,
    we occasionally meet with these birds in the lowlands; they are,
    however, rather recluse, affecting woods and lonely places. Here as
    they hop from one twig to another, or sit hid in the foliage of a thick
    tree, they utter a rapid, and not unmusical succession of notes, as if
    attempting to compress them all into one. Some idea may be formed of
    it, by playing <em>with one hand</em> the following notes on a pianoforte.</p>

  <p>[Music]</p>

  <p>The notes are occasionally poured forth in the air as the bird
    flits from tree to tree. But very commonly it is heard, without any
    variation, from the male<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span> and female alternately, seated on two trees,
    perhaps on the opposite sides of a road; thus:—The Mountain Dick calls,
    and the Judy immediately answers; then a little pause;—another call
    from the Mountain Dick, and an instant answer from Judy;—until, after
    a few successions, the Judy gallantly yields the point, and flies over
    to the other tree to join his friend. In February, I have heard it
    repeating a note somewhat like <em>che-w</em>.</p>

  <p>This species is bold and fierce in self-defence, the female no less
    than the male. On several occasions, when I have shot, and but slightly
    wounded, one, it would make vigorous efforts to escape by running;
    but on being taken in the hand and held by the legs, it would elevate
    the crown feathers, turn the head up and bite fiercely at my fingers,
    seizing and pinching the flesh with all its force; striving at the
    same time to clutch with its claws, and screaming vociferously. I
    have never seen it pursue other birds in the aggressive manner of
    the true Tyrants; nor, as far as I am aware, does it capture insects
    in the air, notwithstanding that the rictus is defended by stiff
    bristles. Stationary insects are usually the contents of the stomach,
    particularly large bugs, (<i>Pentatoma</i>) and caterpillars, and
    sometimes the eggs of insects. In the winter the berries of the
    <i>Bursera</i> or Tropic Birch, constitute a large portion of its food.</p>

  <p>In April the Judy begins to arrange the domestic economy of the season;
    and if the cradle of his young is not so elaborate a structure as
    some others, it makes up in quantity what it lacks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span> in quality. In
    the latter part of this month, my negro lads, being on a shooting
    excursion, observed on Bluefields Mountain, a domed nest, made
    apparently of dried leaves, about as large as a child’s head, suspended
    from the under side of a pendent branch of a tall tree. They watched
    awhile to discover the owner, and presently saw the female of the
    present species enter, and re-emerge, while the male was hopping
    about the tree. A day or two after, I myself observed a similar nest,
    similarly situated, beneath one of the pendent branches of a tall
    cotton-tree, at Cave, on the road to Savanna-le-Mar. It appeared to
    be composed of loose trash, rather a ragged structure, but evidently
    domed, with the entrance near the bottom. Both the male and female
    were playing and calling around it, and the latter at length went
    in. On the 11th of May, passing that way again, I observed this nest
    to be considerably larger, not less than a foot in diameter, as well
    as I could judge from the great elevation; its outline, however, was
    still ragged. I estimated the height of the nest to be between seventy
    and eighty feet, though on the lowest branch of the tree, and that
    pendent. Yet this Ceiba had not attained the giant dimensions common
    to the species. A few days after this, Sam saw a third nest, formed
    and placed exactly as in the former cases, so that I concluded this
    to be the usual economy. A fourth example, however, showed me, that
    the lofty elevation is not indispensable, as also that I had not yet
    seen the largest specimens of the nests. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> a branch of a small cedar
    (<i>Cedrela</i>) that overhangs the high-road at Cave, I had noticed
    early in June what appeared to be a heap of straw, tossed up by a fork
    and lodged there, which the action of the weather had in some degree
    smoothed at the top, the ends trailing downwards. One day, however,
    as I was looking up at it, I saw the brown female of this species
    emerge from the bottom, and presently return, entering at a narrow
    hole beneath. As it was not more than twelve or fifteen feet from the
    ground, I immediately sent my lads to climb the tree, and cut the
    branch, which they accordingly brought me, with the huge nest attached.
    The boys reported that it was empty, and that it had four entrances;
    but on examination, I found that every one of these was merely a hollow
    in the immense walls, produced by the receding of one part of the loose
    materials from another. While they held it up in the position it had
    occupied on the tree, I searched beneath for the true entrance; which,
    when I had found it, I had much difficulty to find again, so concealed
    was it by the long draggling ends of the mass. On inserting my finger,
    however, I felt the soft and warm plumage of young birds, and pulled
    out three, almost fully fledged. All three had the plumage of the
    female, but one was manifestly darker than the others: if this was,
    as I presume, a cock, the conclusion above, that the young male bears
    the livery of the female, is confirmed. As I did not want the young,
    I placed them on a lower limb of a large tree in the yard; and as, on
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> next day, I saw two of them about the tree lively and active, and
    as one flew a distance of, perhaps, thirty feet, I trust that they did
    well, and survived their premature exposure to the world. To return to
    the nest, however: I found it a loose, oblong mass, flattened on two
    sides, measuring in height about two and a half feet, (though the ends
    hung down to the length of four feet,) in width more than two feet,
    and in thickness about one foot. It was composed almost entirely of
    the stems and tendrils of passion flowers, mixed, however, and that
    all through the structure, with bright-yellow, silky spiders’ nests,
    and the downy filaments of some cottony herbs. The cavity was not
    larger than a man’s two fists, and was not, in any measure, lined: it
    descended within the entrance, though the latter faced the ground.</p>

  <p>This modest little bird is not uncommon throughout the year. It
    manifests little fear of approach, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>allowing one to come within a few
    feet, as it peeps about among the twigs of low trees and shrubs. It
    rather seems to have a good deal of curiosity, for it will peep at a
    person approaching, and if he move slowly and avoid anything to provoke
    alarm, will hop gradually down from twig to twig, stretching out its
    neck, until it is almost within touch. Three or four will sometimes
    chase each other among the branches, and from bush to bush, uttering
    at intervals a monotonous chirruping. Its notes are very varied;
    sometimes a loud <em>chewurr</em>, or <em>sweet-will</em>, uttered with
    deliberation and much mellowness of tone. I have heard it in March
    uttering with surprising loudness a single clear and shrill whistle,
    slightly modulated: after a while it changed this to a double note,
    <em>to-whit, to-whit</em>, equally loud and piercing. About the
    same season I have listened to <em>che-che-che-churrrr</em>; and in May,
    <em>sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, tŏ-too</em>.</p>

  <p>I have never found anything but seeds in the stomach of this bird;
    though I do not doubt that it eats insects also.</p>

  <p>The White-eyed Flycatcher is one of those species that are only
    partially migratory; during the summer it spreads over the United
    States. It is found throughout the year in our sultry island, though
    with diminished numbers in the summer.</p>

  <p>Much oftener heard than seen, though not unfamiliar to either sense,
    this sober-coloured bird is one of those whose notes have such a
    similarity to articulations as to procure them a common appellation.
    The Flycatchers, in general, are not very vociferous, but this is
    pertinacious in its tri-tonous call, repeating it with energy every
    two or three seconds. It does not ordinarily sit on a prominent twig,
    or dart out after insects, though I have seen one in eager, but
    unsuccessful pursuit of a butterfly (<i>Terias</i>), but it seems to
    love the centre of thick trees, where it sits announcing its presence,
    or flits from bough to bough as you approach; so that it is not easy to
    get a sight of it.</p>

  <p>This bird does not winter with us, but leaves with the Grey
    Petchary, at the beginning of October. It returns early, and
    like the bird just <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>named, evidently makes an eastward progress,
    arriving at the south-west end of the island first. On the
    26th of March, on my return to Bluefields, after a visit to
    Spanish town, I heard its well-known voice, but my lad had
    noticed it a week before. From this time, every grove, I might
    almost say every tree, had its bird, uttering with incessant
    iteration and untiring energy, from its umbrageous concealment,
    <em>Sweet-John!—John-to-whit!—sweet-John-to-whit!—
    John-t’whit!—sweet-John-to—whit!</em>—I can scarcely
    understand how the call can be written “<em>Whip-Tom-Kelly</em>” as
    the accent, if I may so say, is most energetically on the last
    syllable. Nor have I ever heard this appellation given to it in
    Jamaica. After July we rarely hear <em>John-to-whit</em>,—but,
    <em>to-whit—to-whoo</em>; and sometimes a soft simple chirp, or
    <em>sip, sip</em>, whispered so gently as scarcely to be audible.
    This, however, I have reason to believe, is the note of the young, for
    I have heard young ones repeatedly utter it, when sitting on a twig,
    receiving from time to time, with gaping beak, and quivering wing, the
    food contributed by the dam.</p>

  <p>The food of the John-to-whit is both animal and vegetable. In March I
    have found in its stomach the seeds of the Tropic Birch, and in April
    the berries of Sweet-wood, in an unripe state. In the same month, I
    observed one hunting insects by the borders of Bluefields rivulet in
    which I was bathing; and so intent was it upon its occupation, that it
    allowed me to approach within a foot of it before it flew. It sought
    insects successfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span> among the grass and low herbage, perching on
    the stalks of the weeds, and jumping out after stationary, as well
    as vagrant, prey. I observed it eat two spiders’ nests, which it
    masticated, as if peculiarly savoury. As it sat, it vomited a little
    white body, which I found to be the globose seed of the misseltoe berry.</p>

  <p>Incubation takes place in June and July. The nest is rather a neat
    structure, though made of coarse materials. It is a deep cup, about
    as large as an ordinary tea-cup, narrowed at the mouth; composed of
    dried grass, intermixed with silk-cotton, and sparingly with lichen and
    spiders’ nests, and lined with thatch-threads. It is usually suspended
    between two twigs, or in the fork of one, the margin being over-woven,
    so as to embrace the twigs. This is very neatly performed. Specimens
    vary much in beauty: one before me is particularly neat and compact,
    being almost globular in form, except that about one-fourth of the
    globe is wanting, as it is a cup. Though the walls are not thick,
    they are very firm and close, the materials being well woven. These
    are fibres of grass-like plants, moss, a few dry leaves, flat papery
    spiders’ nests, with a little cotton or down for the over-binding
    of the edges. It is lined smoothly with fibres, I know not of what
    plant, as slender as human hair. Another nest, similarly formed, has
    the cavity almost filled with a mass of white cotton, which looks as
    if thrust in by man, but that those filaments of the mass that are in
    contact with the sides, are interwoven with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> the other materials. As
    it is picked cotton, it must be a bit stolen from some house or yard,
    not plucked by the bird from the capsule. The eggs, commonly three in
    number, are delicately white, with a few small red-brown spots, thinly
    scattered over the surface, sometimes very minute and few. Their form
    is a somewhat pointed oval, measuring ⁹⁄₁₀ inch, by rather less than ¹³⁄₂₀.</p>

  <p>For the history of this elegant bird, which has never fallen under my
    notice in Jamaica, I refer to the American ornithologists. My reason
    for noticing it here, is the following note of Mr. Hill’s.</p>

  <p>“In severe winters on the continent, we have been visited by that
    American species of the Waxwing usually called the Cedar-bird. I have
    been informed that in the Christmas of 1836, several in a flock were
    seen about the cashaw-trees of Spanish town. Nothing is known of their
    habits with us, except that they were shy, and scudded about, a dozen
    or twenty together, and very prominently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span> displayed the scarlet,
    wax-like ornaments resulting from the flattening of the shafts of the
    secondary feathers of the wings.”</p>

  <p>Wandering among the woods on the summit of the mountain ridge that
    rises behind Bluefields, I had often heard in the spring, proceeding
    from the deep forests, a single clear note, lengthened and mellow as
    the tone of a flute, sometimes alone, sometimes followed by another,
    about two tones lower. The notes were singularly sweet, and their
    sudden recurrence at rather long intervals, in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>lone and sombre
    silence of that lofty elevation, imparted to them a romantic character,
    which made me very desirous to discover their author. As the summer
    came on, however, I ceased to hear them: but in the beginning of
    October, as I was wandering again in the same locality, I was again
    startled by the interesting sounds. As I proceeded on the very lonely
    road, through the humid woods, where the trees were loaded with
    orchideæ and wild-pines, and the dank stones hidden by ferns and
    mosses, the notes became more frequent and evidently nearer. It being
    useless for a white man, with shoes, to attempt to follow retiring
    birds among the matted woods, tangled and choked with climbers, and
    strewn with loose stones, I sent in Sam with a gun, with orders to
    follow the sound. He crept silently to a spot whence he heard it
    proceed, and saw two birds of this species, which neither he nor I
    had seen before, chasing each other among the boughs. He shot one
    of them. As he was coming out into the road, he imitated the sound
    by whistling, and was immediately answered by another bird, which
    presently came flying to the place where he was, and alighted on a tree
    at a little distance. He fired at this also, and it fell; but emitted
    the remarkable note at the moment of falling.</p>

  <p>But it is at early day,—when the dew lies so heavily on the
    broad-leafed cocoes of the provision grounds, that from every leaf
    you might collect a gill of sparkling water; while the mosses and
    ground-ferns are moist as a saturated sponge;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> before the sun has
    peeped over the distant mountain-peaks, and before the light has
    struggled into the gloomy forest on either side;—it is at early day,
    that if we traverse some narrow rocky bridle-path that winds around the
    hill-sides, choked up with jointer and glass-eye berry, and overhung
    by towering Santa Marias, cabbage-palms, and tree-ferns, we become
    familiar with this interesting bird. The voices of many are then heard
    saluting the opening day, some near at hand, some scarce audible in the
    distance; and as all do not pipe in the same key, we sometimes hear
    beautiful and startling chords produced. Although there is a richness
    in the tones, which the human voice in whistling can by no means
    attain, yet the birds will frequently respond to an imitation of their
    call. Now and then we may obtain a sight of one, or a pair, as they
    seem generally in pairs, sitting, with a melancholy absorbed air, on
    some low tree a little way within the forest, manifesting little alarm
    or curiosity.</p>

  <p>It was soon after I became acquainted with this bird that I received
    the following note from Mr. Hill: in reference to an intention which I
    then had of ascending that magnificent ridge called the Blue Mountains,
    whose summits are 8000 feet high.—“There are two living attractions
    in these mountains, a crested snake, and a sweetly mysterious singing
    bird called the Solitaire. This bird is a Thrush, and it is worth a
    journey to hear his wonderful song. I find among some detached notes
    of mine, the following memorandum respecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span> a similar bird in the
    smaller West Indian islands. ‘The precipitous sides of the Souffriere
    mountain in St. Vincent,’ says a writer describing the volcano which
    so disastrously broke out there in 1812, ‘were fringed with various
    evergreens, and aromatic shrubs, flowers, and many Alpine plants. On
    the north and south sides of the base of the cone were two pieces of
    water, one perfectly pure and tasteless, the other strongly impregnated
    with sulphur and alum. This lonely and beautiful spot was rendered
    more enchanting by the singularly melodious notes of a bird, an
    inhabitant of those upper solitudes, and altogether unknown to the
    other parts of the island; hence supposed to be invisible, though it
    certainly has been seen, and is a species of merle.’ I extract my notes
    on the Haytian bird: though I have seen Jamaica specimens, I never
    visited their mountain haunts. ‘As soon as the first indications of
    day-light are perceived, even while the mists hang over the forests,
    these minstrels are heard pouring forth their wild notes in a concert
    of many voices, sweet and lengthened like those of the harmonica
    or musical glasses. It is the sweetest, the most solemn, and most
    unearthly of all the woodland singing I have ever heard. The lofty
    locality, the cloud-capt heights, to which alone the eagle soars in
    other countries,—so different from ordinary singing-birds in gardens
    and cultivated fields,—combine with the solemnity of the music to
    excite something like devotional associations. The notes are uttered
    slowly and distinctly, with a strangely-measured exactness. Though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
    it is seldom that the bird is seen, it can scarcely be said to be
    solitary, since it rarely sings alone, but in harmony or concert
    with some half-dozen others chanting in the same glen. Occasionally
    it strikes out into such an adventitious combination of notes, as to
    form a perfect tune. The time of enunciating a single note, is that of
    the semi-breve. The quaver is executed with the most perfect trill.
    It regards the major and minor cadences, and observes the harmony of
    counter-point, with all the preciseness of a perfect musician. Its
    melodies, from the length and distinctness of each note, are more
    hymns than songs. Though the concert of singers will keep to the same
    melody for an hour, each little coterie of birds chants a different
    song, and the traveller by no accident ever hears the same tune.’”
    In another letter he says, “Buffon notices the Solitaire under the
    title of the Organist. He thus speaks of it,—‘In St. Domingo the name
    of <em>Organist</em> has been given to this little bird, because, in
    ascending from grave to sharp, it sounds all the tones of the octave.
    It is not only very singular but very agreeable. Chevalier Fabre
    Deshayes writes, that, in the southern parts of St. Domingo in the high
    mountains, there is a very rare but very celebrated bird, called the
    <em>Musician</em>, whose song can be set down by notes. The Musician of
    M. Deshayes, it is to be presumed, is the same with our Organist.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
    In M. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>Page Dupretz’s History of Louisiana, there is a description of a
    small bird which they call the Bishop, and which we believe to be the
    same with our Organist. Its plumage being blue passing into violet,
    it has hence obtained the name of Bishop. It is so sweet-throated,
    so flexible in its tones, and so soft in its warblings, that those
    who once hear it become somewhat measured in their praises of the
    Nightingale. The notes of its song are lengthened out like those of a
    <em>miserere</em>. Whilst it sings it does not seem to draw breath; but
    it rests a double time before it recommences, and this alternation of
    singing and resting will be continued for two hours.’”</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="label">[57]</a> There is some confusion here. Our Solitaire has no
      resemblance to “L’Organiste de St. Domingue,” Pl. Enl. 809, (<i>Pipra
      musica</i> of Gmel. and Lath.) nor to “L’Euphone Organiste” of Vieillot
      (Gal. Ois.) which is an Euphonia, allied to our Blue Quit, (see p.
      238,) but with brighter colours. I incline to think that Deshayes
      is writing of our bird; but certainly not the others, unless they
      attribute the notes erroneously.
  </div>

  <p>When I received these notes from my friend, and had identified my
    bird with his description, I had never heard more than two notes in
    succession. Curiosity impelled me to visit their lofty solitudes often
    through the winter, and at length on the 3rd of February, when they
    were abundant, I heard three successive notes of different tones,
    proceed from the same bird; exactly like so many notes of a psalm,
    played in slow time. And about three weeks later, I find this note in
    my journal; I have at length heard the <em>song</em> of the Solitaire;
    the long clear notes, followed by many others of varying length, and
    different tones, but separated by pauses rather too long to make a
    piece of music, causing the whole to seem disjointed; but with much
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>sweetness. If I may conjecture, these true melodies are peculiar to
    the nuptial season, and indicate that the period of incubation is
    either begun or near; a time that generally exerts much influence on
    the singing of birds.</p>

  <p>From that time they filled the woods with their solemn music, until
    April; when they began to become scarce, and by the middle of May not
    one was to be heard or seen. I concluded that they were migratory, and
    had now departed from the island for the summer; but on mentioning the
    fact to Mr. Hill, he informed me about the beginning of June, that a
    friend of his who had travelled through the Coona-coonas a day or two
    before, (a district of the Blue Mountains, in which Mr. Purdie heard
    them in his botanical tour, and at the same season,) had heard them
    singing by scores. And he adds, “My Haytian notes relate to two visits
    to the mountains they inhabit in that neighbour island; the first was
    in August, the second in June; and they were there in the lofty pine
    forests in hundreds.” The curious fact of the total disappearance of
    the species from the Bluefields Peaks during the summer, while yet
    present in the island, leads me to conjecture, that they may be subject
    to the same instinct as influences migratory birds, but leading them
    to seek a colder climate, not in a northern latitude, but in a loftier
    elevation. The Peaks of Bluefields, though the highest land in the
    western part of the island, are not more than 2600 feet high, and
    therefore far less elevated than the ridges of the eastern end.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

  <p>As far as I know, the food of the Solitaire is exclusively berries:
    I have never found an insect in the stomachs of many that I have
    dissected. Mr. Hill found in one, the berries of a mountain Rubus,
    like the blackberry. In the Autumn, I have detected those of the
    misseltoe, but more commonly those called glass-eye berries, from their
    constituting the chief food of the Merle of that name. In February, the
    pimento groves, which cover the mountain-brow are loaded with fruit,
    not soft and sweet and black, as when ripe, but hard and green, and
    in the very state in which it is picked to be dried for commerce. The
    temptation of these berries draws the Solitaires from their seclusion,
    and we not only hear their clear notes trilled from every part of the
    groves, but see them familiarly eating, at the edges of the pastures,
    and by the roadsides. It is worthy of remark that their companions
    in retirement, the Glass-eyes, accompany them also in these feeding
    excursions, and partake of the feast. I found the stomachs of both
    species at this season, loaded with the green pimento.</p>

  <p>The two specimens which first came into my hands, early in October,
    manifested signs of a seasonal change of plumage. One had the head
    prettily covered with pale rusty spots, each feather being thus tipped:
    several of the body feathers were similarly tipped. This was moulting,
    and I perceived that it was the old feathers which were tipped, the
    new ones being uniformly grey, whence I infer the spotted character to
    be that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span> summer dress, perhaps extending to all the clothing
    feathers. The other specimen exhibited the same peculiarity, but in a
    less degree.</p>

  <p>I have much pleasure in adding the following note contained in a letter
    from my friend, received since my arrival in England. Mr. Hill, having
    made some inquiries of a gentleman residing among the Blue Mountains,
    Andrew G. Johnston, Esq., received the following reply:—“I have no copy
    of my musical score of the Solitaire’s song. The bird <em>now</em> [July
    27th] uses only its long breve notes and its octave, often
    out of tune, more often so than perfect. In the spring they are very
    numerous in the deep forests, and warble very prettily, somewhat like
    this:—</p>

  <p>The pointed crotchets are very sweet sounds, and seem to sound
    <img style="height: 1.3em; vertical-align: -0.08em;" src="images/p206_accents.jpg" alt="E—vil evil">. I tried in vain to get one this spring,
    but I find the negroes know nothing about them. Hearing them one day
    singing, I asked two maroon-men who also listened, what birds they
    were. One said <em>a grey speckled bird, mottled like a guinea-fowl</em>:
    the other that it was black, and red about the rump and under the
    wings.” My conjectures on both points, are thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
    confirmed. I may add that the most common notes that I have heard are these.</p>

  <p>Vieillot, who first described the species by the name of <i>Muscicapa
    armillata</i>, says that “it inhabits the Antilles, but is very rare
    in the greater islands.” His figure, pl. 42, is poor, both as regards
    form and colour. Mr. Swainson’s figure of <i>Myiadestes genibarbis</i>,
    (Nat. Lib. Flycatchers, pl. 13,) <em>if meant</em> for this species, is
    better as to colouring, but neither its form nor attitude is correct.
    Moreover, as he says, its body is not much larger than that of the
    robin, and mentions white lines on the black ear-coverts, it is with me
    a matter of doubt; especially as he speaks of the intimate resemblance
    which it bears to our common robin, “not merely in the red colour of
    the throat,” but in form; a resemblance certainly not discoverable in
    the living bird.</p>

  <p>The figure in Mr. Gray’s Genera of Birds was drawn from one of the
    specimens procured by me in Jamaica, and is in winter plumage.</p>

  <p>This fine bird was brought to Mr. Hill, about the end of the year
    1844, from the mountains of St. Andrews, by a negro who stated that
    he had caught it near Newcastle. Its wings were cut; which at once
    excited the suspicion that it had been a caged bird, but, on a moment’s
    examination, it was perceived that its perfect cleanness and the
    smoothness of its plumage decisively indicated a state of freedom and
    wildness. The man stated that having caught it alive in the garden of
    his cottage, which, (from the circumstance that the cottage-gardens,
    in the precipitous mountains, often run into narrow cliffs and
    corners, environed as if by enormous walls,) he might readily do, he
    had endeavoured to keep it alive, and had clipped both its wings for
    its detention. After a few days, however, it died, probably for want
    of proper food, and he brought it to Kingston, to dispose of it for a
    trifle.</p>

  <p>In the wildest parts of the mountain regions of Jamaica, where the
    perilous path winds round a towering cone on the one hand, and on the
    other looks down into a deep and precipitous gully; or where a narrow
    track, choked up with tree-ferns on which the vertical sun looks only
    at noon-day, leads through the dark and damp forest to some lonely
    negro ground, the traveller is startled by the still wilder tones of
    the Jabbering Crow. So uncouth and yet so articulate, so varied in
    the inflexions of their tones, are these sounds, that the wondering
    stranger can with difficulty believe he is listening to the voice of
    a bird, but rather supposes he hears the harsh consonants, and deep
    guttural intonations of some savage language. All <span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>the Crows are
    garrulous, and several are capable of tolerable imitations of human
    speech, but the present is the only example I am aware of, in which
    the language of man is resembled by a bird in a state of nature. The
    resemblance, however, is rather general than particular; every one who
    hears it is struck with its likeness to speech, though he cannot detect
    any known words: it is the language of a foreigner. One cannot easily
    convey an idea of the sounds by writing; but the following fragments
    which the negroes have been able to catch from the learned bird’s own
    mouth, will give some notion of their character. “Walk fast, crāb! do
    buckra work.—Cuttacoo<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> better than wallet.” It must not be supposed
    that these words uniformly represent the sounds; these and similar
    combinations of harsh consonants and broad vowels, are varied <i>ad
    infinitum</i>, as are also the tones in which they are expressed. For
    myself, I have thought them ludicrously like the very peculiar voice
    of Punch in a puppet-show; others have fancied in them half-a dozen
    Welshmen quarrelling. These strange sounds are generally poured forth
    in <em>sentences</em>, of varying length, from the summit of some lofty
    tree, or in the course of the bird’s passage from one to another.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In some parts of the mountains they are not uncommon, though their
    loquacity would induce us to think them more numerous than they are,
    for we rarely see more than two or three at once. They are social,
    but not gregarious; and much of their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>time is spent in visiting
    successively the summits of those trees that tower above the rest
    of the forest, the Santa-Maria, the bread-nut, the broad-leaf, and
    the cotton-tree. As these visitations are often performed alone,
    I imagine that the gabbling cries are calls to their companions,
    especially as, if another comes within hearing, he is pretty sure to
    visit his clamorous brother, and enter into noisy conversation with
    him. After spending a few minutes on one tree, during which they
    do not, <em>generally</em>, change their position, otherwise than by
    walking deliberately along the branch, they both wing their way to the
    next station, not side by side, but one a little behind the other,
    both calling as they go. The bleached and bare limbs of a dry tree
    are always selected, when one of the requisite elevation is within
    range, as affording most fully that which they seem to delight in,
    an unobstructed prospect. Sometimes they do alight on lower trees,
    but then they are very wary and suspicious, so that it is a difficult
    matter to get within shot of one. When out of gun range, which they
    seem to estimate pretty accurately, they are much more careless of
    a passing stranger. Their flight is heavy and slow. They scarcely
    ever desert the solitudes of the mountains; two thousand feet is the
    lowest limit at which I have known them, with two exceptions. The one
    is that in certain lofty woods surrounding the extensive morass in
    Saltspring Pen, near Black river, I have heard the voices of these
    birds clamorously uttered, in the latter part of November. The other
    instance occurred behind Pedro Bluff, but little above the level of the
    sea, where I heard this bird in June.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

  <p>The food of the Jabbering Crow is principally vegetable. Of several
    shot in autumn, the stomachs contained various berries, some fleshy,
    others farinaceous. The stomach is a muscular sac, but not a gizzard.
    Descending in the early months of the year to the ripening sour sops,
    on which it feeds, it is then much more approachable, but at the same
    time more silent. And about the same time, the seed of the bitter wood
    is ripe, which also attracts him. One of these trees is in the yard of
    a house at Content, where I occasionally sojourned; this was generally
    visited at dawn of day, and sometimes in the evening, by the Crows. I
    have been amused by the intelligence which they manifest in approaching
    it: a company of two or three will come into the neighbourhood,
    and alight with much clamour on some tree in the woods, a few rods
    distant; we hear no further sound, but presently one and another are
    seen stealing on silent wing to the bitter-wood, where they nibble the
    berries in all stillness and quiet. I could not help thinking that the
    noisy and ostentatious alighting on the first tree was but a feint
    to prevent suspicion, as if they should say, “Here we are, you see;
    this is the place that we frequent.” And this, I am informed, is not
    an accidental case, but a habit. The pimento also, which in its green
    state is eaten by so many of our birds, tempts the Jabbering Crow in
    February from his forest fastnesses, to the low but dense groves that
    clothe the mountain brows.</p>

  <p>An intelligent person has informed me, that it will take advantage of a
    small bird’s being entangled in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span> withe, to kill and eat it; and that
    when a boy, amusing himself by setting springes for small birds, he has
    occasionally known them to be taken out of the springe by the Jabbering
    Crow. These statements, at least as far as the animal appetite is
    concerned, are in some measure confirmed by an experiment with one
    I had alive. One day in December, hearing a strange querulous sound
    proceeding from the top of the woods near me, I sent Sam to find the
    cause. He ascertained it to proceed from one of two Jabbering Crows,
    perched side by side on the top of a tree; the vociferous one being
    evidently young, though in full plumage, and capable of flight, for it
    was shivering its wings, while with open beak receiving something from
    the mouth of the other, doubtless its parent. He shot the old one, and
    slightly wounding it in the wing, brought it to the ground, where it
    ran so vigorously, that he had difficulty in securing it. It was rather
    formidable too; for it clutched his hand with its claws so forcibly, as
    to give pain; and afterwards, as I was holding it, it nipped my finger
    with the point of its powerful beak, and took the piece out. When
    turned into a room, it climbed about the various objects, by walking,
    and taking considerable jumps, striving to gain the highest elevation
    it could attain, where it sat, moody, but watchful. I presented to
    it the flesh of one side of the breast of a bird just skinned. He
    seized it greedily, and, after carrying it about a little, attempted
    to swallow it. In this he did not succeed without many efforts, as the
    piece was large: he several times tried to toss it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span> while in his beak,
    and also drew it out by setting his foot on it, and took it in another
    position; but seemed to have no power of dividing it.</p>

  <p>Robinson says, “They are great devourers of ripe plantains and bananas,
    and also rob the wild pigeons of their eggs and young. When tame, they
    are very droll and diverting, and as arrant thieves as our Jackdaws
    and Magpies, stealing knives, spoons, thimbles, &amp;c., and hiding them.
    They abandon all such plantations as have the woods much cleared away
    from them, of which there have been many instances. They are often seen
    stooping down and drinking the water that is deposited in the bosom
    of the leaves of the largest wild pines. When employed in stealing
    plantains, they are said to be very silent, but at other times are
    the most loquacious, noisy animals breathing. I have been informed
    by some very creditable persons, that they will attack and destroy a
    yellow-snake; their method is to fly upon him one after another, and
    tearing away a mouthful of his skin and flesh, retreat. This they do
    with great nimbleness, and with impunity, till they have devoured the
    poor animal alive.” (MSS.)</p>

  <p>Once in walking in a very lonely wood, I came suddenly on a Jabbering
    Crow sitting on a low tree just over my head; the bird was evidently
    startled, and in the surprise quite lost its <em>presence of mind</em>;
    for instead of making off with the usual clamour, it flew mute to
    another low tree a few yards off, where it sat peeping at me in
    silence, until I shot it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

  <p>I have never met with the nest; but a young friend, to whom I am
    indebted for several interesting facts, tells me, that about the
    beginning of last June, he was accustomed to see a pair on a very lofty
    cotton-tree, which he thought were nesting. He repeatedly saw them go
    and “lie down,” as he expressed it, in a large bunch of wild-pine,
    where they would remain for some time; and when one flew out, the
    other, which had been sitting on the same tree, would go and sit in the
    place. Usually the bird will leave its position on the slightest alarm,
    but when either of these was in its hollow, nothing would induce it
    to fly. He on one occasion fired thrice at the sitting bird, but she
    would not leave her place, and the situation was too lofty for the shot
    to reach her. The approach of the birds to the wild-pine was always
    perfectly silent and cautious; but they would dart out on any other
    bird flying near, and drive it away with clamour. On the whole, I have
    no doubt that this pair had a nest in the wild-pine.</p>

  <p>The same young friend once witnessed a singular rencontre between two
    Jabbering Crows, and two Red-tail Buzzards, and in this case it is
    probable that parental solicitude gave the desperate courage. A single
    Hawk flying along was pounced upon by a Crow from a neighbouring tree,
    and a flying fight commenced, the Hawk thrusting forth his talons
    in endeavour to clutch, in which he once succeeded, and the Crow
    repeatedly striking his enemy forcibly with his sharp and powerful
    beak. Now and then each would rise perpendicularly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span> pounce down
    upon the other: this was principally but not solely, the manner of
    the Buzzard, the Crow usually striking his blow, and then retreating
    obliquely. After some time a second Hawk approached, which was attacked
    by another Crow; and now the melée went on in the same manner between
    the four combatants. The conflict lasted near ten minutes, and at
    length terminated in favour of the Crows, who fairly drove their
    opponents off the aerial field, pursuing them with pertinacity to a
    great distance. At the moment of my writing down this account, it
    was in a measure confirmed by my actually observing a Jabbering Crow
    pursuing with insult a Buzzard over the woods: it was strange to see,
    that after he had returned from the pursuit, he himself was attacked by
    a little Petchary, to whose superior prowess he was fain to yield, and
    flee in his turn.</p>

  <p>In the latter part of May and early in June, which I presume to be the
    season of incubation, the singular chattering is almost relinquished
    for a much more monotonous cawing, somewhat like the note of the Rook,
    but uttered more pertinaciously, and more <em>impatiently</em>.</p>

  <p>Robinson states that “they build their nest with slender twigs in the
    manner of Rooks on the tops of lofty trees, but not more than two
    nests on one tree. When they have young they will suffer nobody to
    take them, assaulting the bold invader with great courage and much
    clamour, fiercely buffeting his face with their wings, at the same
    time endeavouring to pluck out his eyes with their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span> strong beaks.” He
    elsewhere states that “they are said to build in hollow trees.” (MSS.)</p>

  <p>The flesh is not eaten; but having a curiosity to taste it, I had one
    broiled. The flesh of the breast was well-tasted and juicy, but so
    dark, tough, and coarse-grained, that I should readily have mistaken it
    for <em>beef</em>.</p>

  <p>I found the tracheal muscles of this bird large and globose.</p>

  <p>The appearance, voice, and habits of this bird had pretty well
    convinced me of its distinctness from <i>Q. versicolor</i>, before I
    was aware that Mr. Swainson had described it in “Two centenaries and a
    quarter,” p. 355. From the length of his specimen, it is probable the
    tail was not fully developed.</p>

  <p>This is one of the first birds which a stranger notices: his
    conspicuous size and glossy plumage, his familiar business-like
    manners, and his very peculiar <span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>metallic cry, at once attract
    attention. Gregarious, but not associating in very great numbers to
    feed, they frequent pastures and open grounds in search of insects,
    not often hopping, (though I have seen one hop,) but walking with a
    swaggering gait, like rooks and crows. When on the ground their time
    is chiefly occupied in searching about among the roots of the grass.
    It is most amusing to stand where one is not observed, at a few yards’
    distance from a Tinkling at work, and to watch the unremitted industry
    with which he labours. He marches rapidly to and fro, turning his head
    in all directions, peeping eagerly hither and thither, now turning
    one eye to a spot, now the other, ever and anon thrusting into the
    earth the beak, which is then forcibly opened to loosen the soil. He
    drags many morsels forth, which he quickly swallows, and searches for
    more. I suspect earthworms and various larvæ that live at the roots of
    grass are the objects of his research. Amidst his constant occupation,
    he does not omit, however, to keep an eye warily on any suspicious
    object. Only shew your person, and you see the singular-looking white
    eye turned up towards you; stir a step towards him, and away he flies,
    uttering his very peculiar cry, his long tail folded on itself, and
    resembling a vertical fan. As he sits on a tree, he will now and then
    elevate the fan-like tail, ruffle up the plumage, throw back the head,
    and with the beak wide open, utter two or three most singular notes,
    which I can compare to nothing but the sounds produced by repeatedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
    striking with force a piece of sonorous metal, relieved occasionally
    by the creaking of a schoolboy’s pencil upon a slate. “There are,”
    observes Mr. Hill, “two or three fine modulations, followed by a sudden
    break down into the harsh grating sounds of the ungreased wheels of a
    heavy-loaded truck.” It is to the first of these notes that the bird
    before us owes his local names of Tinkling, Tintin, Clinkling, and,
    among the Spaniards of St. Domingo, Chinchiling.</p>

  <p>Like the Ani, the Tinkling feeds on the parasites of cattle. Walking
    among them, and mounting on their backs, they pick off the ticks that
    so sadly infest the poor beasts, who, as if appreciating the service,
    offer not the slightest molestation to their kind friends. I one day
    observed a Tinkling thus engaged in feeding her offspring. It was in
    the picturesque pasture of Peter’s Vale, where kine were numerous.
    Beneath the grateful shade of a spreading mango, in the heat of the
    day, a cow was peacefully ruminating. At her feet was the old Tinkling,
    walking round and looking up at her, with an intelligent eye. Presently
    she espied a tick upon the cow’s belly, and leaping up, seized it in
    her beak. Then marching to her sable offspring, who stood looking on
    a few yards off, she proceeded to deliver the savoury morsel into the
    throat of her son, who had gaped to the utmost stretch of his throat
    in eager expectation, even before his mother was near him. This done,
    she returned, and again walking round, scrutinized the animal’s body,
    but discovering nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> more, flew up on the cow’s back and commenced
    an investigation there. Just at this moment something alarmed her,
    and both mother and son flew to a distant tree. It was at the same
    time, and in the same pasture, that I observed a number of these birds
    collected in a large bastard-cedar that overhung a shallow pool; to
    which one and another were continually descending, and bathing with
    great apparent enjoyment; after which each flew to a sunny part of the
    tree, and fluttered and pecked, and ruffled its plumage, that it might
    dry smoothly and equally.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hill has observed at Fort Dauphin, on the north side of St.
    Domingo, the Tinkling feeding in flocks of two hundred or more. The low
    grounds around the harbour, consisting of many shallow marly hollows
    are overflowed by the tide, after the prevalence of strong north winds,
    reducing them to marshes. Many marine <i>mollusca</i>, &amp;c. congregating
    in these hollows, are left, by the water evaporating, to putrefy: the
    vicinity is hence very unhealthy, but hither the Tinklings resort in
    large flocks to feed on the decaying animal matters, with which the
    mud is filled. And in Jamaica, my friend has witnessed flocks of these
    birds equally numerous, winging their way, in March, towards Passage
    Fort, an embouchure subject to a similar inundation, on which they
    appeared to descend.</p>

  <p>The food of our Grakle I believe to consist almost, if not quite
    exclusively, of insects, worms, &amp;c. Yet I have seen one in March
    eating a Seville orange on the tree, tugging out large portions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span> of
    the pulp, and swallowing them. But the stomach of this very specimen,
    which I shot in the act, was full of comminuted insects. As it was
    in the midst of very dry weather, the object may have been the
    quenching of its thirst. Robinson in describing the Corato, (<i>Agave
    keratto</i>) notices a fondness of this bird for its nectar, which may
    perhaps be similarly explained. He says of this magnificent plant,
    (MSS. I. 76.) “the flowering stem begins to rise about Christmas, and
    in the beginning of March, the flowers open. The Mocking-birds are
    fond of the honey found at the base of this flower; the Barbadoes
    Blackbirds are also fond of it, and between these birds happen great
    dissensions and bickerings. If the Blackbirds, which are naturally very
    loquacious, would fare well, and hold their tongues, they might feed
    unmolested. But their incessant chattering attracts the attention of
    the Mock-birds, who having at that time young ones, and being doubly
    jealous, assault the Blackbirds with great fierceness and vigour, soon
    obliging them to quit the plant, and hide themselves among the trees
    and bushes.”</p>

  <p>Of two which I shot in January, the stomach of one presented a singular
    appearance, being stuffed with green herbage, like very fine grass,
    chopped excessively small. I had noticed several caterpillars among the
    mass, but it was not until I dispersed it in water, that I discovered
    it to consist of the contents of the caterpillars’ stomachs, expressed
    by the muscular action of the gizzard. There were no less than nineteen
    caterpillars, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span> smooth, and I think grass-eating kinds, some of
    which still contained portions of comminuted herbage. The stomach of
    the other contained about as many caterpillars, besides other larvæ,
    some spiders, a moth, and other insects.</p>

  <p>Regularly at nightfall, during the summer, I used to see many parties
    of Tinklings fly over Bluefields, with the usual vociferation, and
    wend their way to a spreading cotton-tree near the seaside, where, I
    was informed, they slept; whence, as regularly one might see them,
    in the early morning, emerging and dispersing to their places of
    diurnal occupation. One evening I went down to watch their arrival and
    proceedings. About half-an-hour before sunset, they began to arrive
    in straggling parties, but did not proceed at once to their roosting
    place, but congregated in a clump of smaller trees, about one hundred
    and fifty yards from it, on the banks of Bluefields River, where they
    clamoured in all sorts of metallic tones with unceasing vociferation.
    Some parties from a distance, coming straight to the roost, suddenly
    altered their course, attracted by the calls of these intermediate
    settlers, and joined them, and some even returned to them, which had
    already passed the spot. A few, however, went on to their destination,
    and when once some were there, their numbers soon increased, for the
    calling now proceeded from both quarters. As the parties arrived,
    one or two single birds kept flying from one station to the other,
    backwards and forwards. At length the whole assembled number on the
    intermediate station<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span> rose as by common consent, and flew in an immense
    flock to the number of nearly two hundred, to the roosting place,
    darkening the air, and making a loud rushing with their united wings.
    Others went on to arrive, until between four and five hundred, (I could
    not count very accurately) had assembled. Long before this, however, I
    had found that the real roosting place was not the large cotton-tree,
    that this was but another station of congregation, for as the evening
    advanced, they began to leave this, and to perch on the fronds of
    four or five cocoa-nut palms that were growing in two lines, of which
    the cotton-tree was the angle. The nearest trees to this point were
    first chosen, and few chose the second, till the first was pretty well
    crowded, nor the third till the second was occupied, and finally the
    numbers on each cocoa-nut were in proportion to its proximity to the
    central point.</p>

  <p>The taking of places was attended with much squabbling; the alighting
    of each new comer on a frond, causing it to swing so as greatly to
    discompose the sitters already in possession, and throw them off their
    balance; and hence each was received by his fellows with open beaks,
    and raised wings to prevent his landing. Still, many thrust themselves
    in among others, pecking right and left in self-defence. The highest
    horizontal fronds were most in demand, and many of these had at the
    close as many as ten or twelve birds each, sitting side by side in a
    sable row. When once the birds had left the cotton-tree, and selected
    their places on the palms, they did not return, but places were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
    shifted continually. During the whole time their singular voices were
    in full cry, and could be heard at a great distance; some idea may be
    formed of the effect of the whole, by imagining two or three hundred
    small table bells of varying tones to be rung at the same time. By
    half-an-hour after sunset, the arrivals had pretty well ceased, and
    most of the birds were quietly settled for the night. I visited them
    on one or two subsequent evenings, but found no material difference in
    their proceedings.</p>

  <p>As the Tinkling roosts in society, so does it build. The nests, to
    the number of twenty or thirty, are placed in a single tree, usually
    a hog-plum, (<i>Spondias graveolens</i>). One of these trees, chosen
    every year as a nesting tree, being on the property of a friend, a
    nest, one of fourteen then built, was brought down for my inspection.
    It consists of a deep, compact, and well-formed cup, the hollow of
    which is as large as a pint basin; the sides, about an inch and a half
    thick, formed of flexible stems of weeds, and stalks of guinea grass.
    It contained three eggs, measuring 1¹⁄₁₀ inch by ⁸⁄₁₀, of a dull
    pale blue-green, singularly marked with sinuated lines of black. I am
    assured that when the company have hatched their broods for the season,
    they tear away with their feet the nests, and scatter the materials;
    and that should any other bird have a nest on the same tree, it is
    mercilessly destroyed with the rest, regardless of the eggs or young
    which it may contain. The nests are placed on the forks of divergent
    branches,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span> near the end of horizontal limbs, at a considerable
    elevation.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hill informs me, on the authority of a friend from Barbadoes,
    that in that island a strange custom prevails among the children, of
    collecting these birds about Shrove Tuesday in every year, and bringing
    them into the towns, where they then play with them, and feed them
    with cockroaches. The origin or the object of this annual amusement
    my friend’s informant could not explain, having left that island when
    himself a child. The same gentleman has observed the Tinklings in
    Jamaica go to the lime trees, and descending beneath the trees pick up
    in their beaks the fallen fruits; then rising to a twig, each would
    take its lime in one foot, and gently rub it over its side beneath the
    wing, transfer it to the other foot, and rub the other side in the same
    way: the object here being doubtless the fine aromatic odour of the
    oil of the bruised rind communicated to the feathers. The observer has
    watched this proceeding by the hour together.</p>

  <p>This pretty bird is a general favourite; social and confiding in his
    manners, without being saucy, he frequents the fruit trees which are
    invariably planted around a Jamaican homestead. On an elevated twig
    he sits and cheers his mate with his clear, melodious song, which he
    trills forth with much energy. Sometimes his notes have considerable
    variety, and may properly be called a song; at others he whistles a
    quick repetition of two clear notes which much resemble the words
    <em>Tom Paine>, Tom Paine</em>, if we attempt to enunciate them
    in whistling. Again, it is a single note quickly repeated, as when we
    whistle to call a dog. Besides these, the Banana bird has other sounds,
    which are very deceiving, and seem the result of imitation.</p>

  <p>Fruit is his principal diet; a ripe banana, or orange, a papaw, or a
    bunch of pimento, presents temptations to him; but perhaps still more
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>acceptable are the various species of <i>Anona</i>, the sops and
    custard-apples, on whose soft and luscious pulp he delights to regale.
    A ripe sour-sop is sure to attract him, in common with the Blue Quits,
    with which he mingles. If the part exposed be decomposing, as is often
    the case, he may be seen tugging vigorously to pull off portions of
    this, which he throws from his beak with a jerk, seeking to arrive at
    a part more palatable. When thus engaged in feeding, and particularly
    when playfully pursuing the hen among the twigs, his bright yellow coat
    glows beautifully through the openings of the green leaves.</p>

  <p>I have observed so frequently as to be worthy of notice, that when
    shot, the Banana bird grasps the twig on which he was sitting, so
    tenaciously as to hang from it, body downwards, until death at length
    relaxes the clasp.</p>

  <p>The nest of this bird is an interesting structure; like that of the
    Baltimore of the Northern continent, it is a deep purse suspended from
    two parallel twigs, or from a fork. One before me is composed chiefly
    of the wiry fibres plucked from the fronds of the Palmetto-thatch,
    with some horse-hair interwoven. Sometimes, where thatch-threads are
    scarce, horse-hair alone is used, and the structure is particularly
    neat. But the more ordinary material is a vegetable substance, so
    closely resembling horse-hair, even on a minute inspection, that I
    have had difficulty in persuading intelligent persons that it was not
    actual hair, till I applied it to the flame of a candle, when it burnt
    without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span> shrivelling. But I am very uncertain what the substance is;
    some say it is the <i>Tillandsia usneoides</i> or “Old man’s beard,”
    a very common tree-parasite, but it assuredly is not this; I have
    suspected it to be the fibrous stem of the Dodder, dried; a nest newly
    made, I observed to be of the bright buff hue of that plant, whence I
    presumed that the stems are sometimes taken in a recent, and even a
    growing state. A friend tells me, that he has, with much gratification,
    watched the process of building. The hairs or threads are procured one
    by one, and carried to the selected spot, where they are deposited
    in a loose heap. From this accumulated mass of material, the work is
    carried on, and progresses rapidly, when once begun. When a few threads
    are laid and interlaced for the base, the work becomes perceptible
    and interesting. Both birds work together; one taking a thread, and
    weaving-in one end, holds down the loose part with his beak; while his
    mate takes the ends of others projecting, and lays them tightly down
    over it, interweaving them with others. Other threads are crossed in
    the same manner, in every direction, until a slight but very compact
    purse is made, resembling a loose cloth. As it hangs, the texture is so
    thin, that a person below can discern the eggs or young within. Four
    eggs are laid, pointed at the less end: they are white, marked with a
    few angular scratches, and large spots of deep brown, and measure 1
    inch by ⁷⁄₁₀. If an intruder attempt to rifle the nest when the young
    are there, both old birds fly round in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span> excessive perturbation, and cry
    <em>Tom Paine’s pick-a-ninny</em>, with vociferous shrillness.</p>

  <p>In March I have dissected females, which displayed a brilliance of
    plumage, <em>in no wise</em> inferior to that of the male.</p>

  <p>I presume this to be the <em>Watchy-picket</em> of Sloane.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hill has mentioned to me two other species of <i>Icterus</i>, both
    black, the one larger, the other smaller, which have been found in

    Edgecumbe.</p>

  <p>In ordinary seasons this well-known bird arrives in vast numbers from
    the United States, in the month of October, and scattering over the
    lowland plains, and slopes of the sea-side hills, assembles in the
    guinea-grass fields, in flocks amounting to five hundred or more.
    The seed is then ripe, and the black throngs settle down upon it, so
    densely, that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>numbers may be killed at a random discharge. To procure
    the seed, the birds perch on the culm, but as the weight would bear
    down a single stalk, each grasps several culms in its foot, while it
    rifles the panicles. At this time, the males are dressed in the sober
    livery of the females. Early in November they depart for the southern
    continent, but during their brief stay they are in great request for
    the table. Dr. Chamberlaine only echoes the general estimation, when
    he says:—“The Butter-bird is a bonne bouche; it is but a mouthful, but
    a luscious and delightful one. Their note,” he adds, “during their
    migration hither, is simply <em>ping, ping, ping</em>:—what
    it may be in its native woods, I do not know. But wounded birds have
    been secured and kept in cages, and when placed in the same room with a
    Canary have soon acquired similar notes, and in time warble with equal
    strength and melody.” (Jam. Alm. 1840; p. 25.)</p>

  <p>When the spring rains have set in, usually in the month of April, they
    again become our transient guests for a few days, on their northward
    migration, when the males are conspicuous in their nuptial dress.
    Other species of grass are now seeding, and the nutritive farinaceous
    grains of many neglected weeds afford them a supply during their brief
    sojourn.</p>

  <p>Though not very numerous, this beautiful bird is well-known, being
    conspicuous from his brilliant colours. He is spread over the country,
    from the mountains of the interior, to the plains of the coast. Rather
    social, though perhaps attracted by a common cause, the abundance of
    food;—we may sometimes see a dozen or more scattered over a large
    bully-tree, from the twigs of which they hang in all positions, while
    they pick the berries. Its flight is rapid, and performed in long
    undulations: during flight, a low sibilant note is uttered; but it is
    usually a silent bird.</p>

  <p>About Spanish Town, it is called the Orange-bird, not from its feeding
    on oranges, but from the resemblance of its plump and glowing breast,
    to that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>beautiful fruit, as it sits among the dark green foliage. It
    is also called the Goldfinch.</p>

  <p>I shot a male in September, and wounding him only in the breast,
    picked him up, more frightened than hurt. I carried him home in my
    handkerchief, and put him into a large cage, where he soon became
    quite a favourite. From the very first he was fearless and lively,
    found the use of the perches immediately, and did not flutter or beat
    himself against the sides, though persons stood close to the cage.
    This was large enough to allow him a short flight; and as there were
    several perches inserted at various heights and distances into the
    sides, he spent a great deal of his time in leaping from one to the
    other, seeming to enjoy it much. Seeing this, I put in one or two more,
    which were no sooner ready than he took notice of them, stretching
    himself towards them, cautiously at first, as if doubtful whether they
    would bear him; soon, however, he ventured boldly, and then took them
    regularly in his course. He always slept on the highest perch, with his
    head behind his wing. He was in full plumage, and his gay breast, and
    the fine contrasts of his striped head and wings, showed him off to
    advantage. I knew nothing that he would eat, save the berries of the
    bully-tree, none of which grew within a considerable distance. I first
    tried him with a few insects, and small earthworms, but he took no
    notice of these: then I gathered a few bunches of fiddle-wood berries,
    which I had no sooner stuck into his cage than I was pleased to see
    him hop towards them, and pick off the ripe ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span> with much relish and
    discrimination. I was informed that in a wild state, he sometimes eats
    the sour-sop; as I had none of this fruit at hand, I gave him pieces
    of a ripe custard-apple and of a guava. He immediately began to eat of
    each, plucking off portions of the pulp, and also taking up the fleshy
    ovaria of which the former is composed, which he chewed with his beak
    till the enclosed seed was pressed out. But all these were forsaken so
    soon as I presented to him bunches of ripe pimento, black and sweet.
    These he picked off greedily, masticating each in the beak, until the
    seeds, which I suppose, were too hotly aromatic for his taste, fell
    out. It was amusing to see the persevering efforts he made to obtain
    those berries, which happened to be a little beyond his reach. He would
    jump from perch to perch impatiently, gazing with outstretched neck at
    the tempting fruit, then jump, and look again; then reach forward to
    them, until in the endeavour, he would overbalance himself, and perform
    an involuntary somerset. Nothing daunted, however, he persevered until
    he ventured to do, what he had been several times on tiptoe to do, leap
    on the bunch itself; and this he continued to do, though with some
    failures, holding on in a scrambling way, now by a leaf, now by the
    berries themselves, until he had rifled the bunch of the ripest.</p>

  <p>After I had kept him about a week, during which his liveliness and good
    temper had much attached him to me, though he made not the slightest
    effort at song, I took him out to cleanse the feathers of his breast
    from the dried blood that had flowed from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span> his wound. I gently rubbed
    them with a soft wet sponge, but whether he took cold, or whether I
    irritated the wound, I know not; but on being returned to the cage, he
    instantly began to breathe asthmatically with open beak, apparently
    with pain; interrupted now and then by fits of coughing, which
    continued all night, and on the next morning he died. On dissection, I
    could not find that the shot had penetrated the chest, but they were
    imbedded in the muscles of the forearm, and had broken the scapula.</p>

  <p>A nest, reported to be of the Cashew bird, was brought me on the 18th
    of June, taken from a pimento tree. It was a thick, circular mat,
    slightly concave, of a loose but soft texture, principally composed
    of cotton, decayed leaves, epidermis of weeds, slender stalks, and
    tendrils of passion-flower, intermingled, but scarcely interwoven. I
    think it probable that this had been sustained by a firmer framework;
    and that the person who took it merely tore out the soft lining as a
    bed on which the eggs might be carried. The child who brought it, could
    give no account of this. The eggs were two, long-oval, taper at the
    smaller end; 1¹⁄₁₀ inch by nearly ⁸⁄₁₀; white, sparingly dashed with
    irregular dusky spots, in a rude ring around the larger end. The embryo
    was at this time formed.</p>

  <p>Of this gay-plumaged stranger, a male and female were seen in March
    of the present year, in that wild and magnificent gorge, called the
    Boca-guas, near Spanish Town. The brilliant appearance of the male,
    attracted the admiration of passers by, and he was at length shot, and
    brought to Mr. Hill.</p>

  <p>About three weeks after this, a male, also in summer dress, occurred to
    my own observation, hopping about the small fruit-trees, on the banks
    of Bluefields River. He was very fearless, allowing me to sit and watch
    him within half-pistol-shot; now and then he flew down to the ground,
    by the side of the water, and remained a few moments peeping about;
    then he would fly up into a shrub, and presently be down again to
    drink; for the season was parched with drought. I watched him full half
    an hour, before he flew away.</p>

  <p>Both these instances show that the Scarlet Tanager, occasionally at
    least, takes our lovely island, in his spring migration from Central
    America to the north. He certainly does not winter with us, having been
    until this season unknown to Mr. Hill, who for many years has paid
    close attention to the migrant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> birds. Yet D’Orbigny states, that it
    winters in Cuba; perhaps, however, but casually.</p>

  <p>The tongue of this species, pencilled and barbed at the tip, might
    give it a place among the Honey-suckers. It does not climb, however,
    nor cling by its feet, but perches. It is not a very common bird in
    the lowlands; but in the mountains I have found it rather plentiful.
    It frequents berry-bearing trees of various species, in small parties,
    with no very strong sociality; its only note is a single <span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>chirp, sharp
    and shrill. Towards the end of the year, when the dark and glossy
    foliage of the orange groves is relieved by the profuse golden fruit,
    reminding the beholder, of the fabled gardens of the Hesperides, this
    Tanager becomes numerous, hopping about the twigs, and pecking holes
    in the ripe fruit. Many are then readily caught by smearing the twigs
    in the vicinity of a half-eaten orange, with bird lime, or “gum,”
    as it is called, the inspissated milk that exudes from an unripe
    naseberry. Females seem to predominate in these foraging parties, in
    the proportion of two or three to one; unless the young males have the
    same livery as their mothers.</p>

  <p>Near the Hallow-well at Content, on a bush whose glossy black berries
    have obtained for it the name of <em>wild pimento</em>, but which is
    better known as <em>rod-wood</em>, we found a nest of the Orange Quit,
    in June. It was a very deep cup, of a coarse texture, rather rudely
    formed of blades of grass, and the leaves of <i>Olyra latifolia</i>,
    interwoven with stalks of grass. It was built on a horizontal branch,
    at the divergence of two twigs, but did not embrace them. Four small
    eggs, ¹³⁄₂₀ inch by ⁵⁄₁₀, contained at that time embryos half matured:
    they were white, splashed with dull red, thinly, except at the larger
    end, where the spots were numerous and confluent. The male probably
    assists in incubation; for he was seen to emerge from the nest.</p>

  <p>A short stumpy bird, and rather inelegant from the shortness of
    its tail, the Blue Quit reminds me of the Nut-hatches. It is very
    common about homesteads, where it frequents fruit-trees, particularly
    the sops: it is, however, nowise infrequent in the woods, both on
    the mountains and in the lowlands. It hops busily about the twigs
    and fruits, picking in any position, back or belly, head or tail,
    uppermost. When the sour-sop is ripe, they flock to it in such numbers,
    that the tree appears covered with them: the negro children then set
    limed twigs for them, and I have had them brought to me thus as fast
    as they could be taken down. The boys cut diagonal notches into the
    bark of a naseberry tree, (<i>Achras</i>), or score an unripe fruit; a
    white milk exudes, so abundant as to drop quickly, and is caught <span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>on a
    leaf. At first it has the consistence of thin cream, but half an hour’s
    exposure thickens it, and gives it tenacity enough to be drawn into
    threads; when they consider it “ripe.” A twig smeared with this “gum,”
    is stuck into the half-eaten sour-sop or custard-apple, presenting a
    very inviting perch to the hungry birds. One soon hops on the fatal
    twig, and is in an instant fluttering helplessly, fast at the feet.
    Banana birds, Mocking birds, and Cashew birds are also taken in this
    way. The appearance of the intestinal viscera at such a season, is very
    singular, being distended with the white pulp throughout their length,
    perfectly visible from the transparency of the intestines. At first
    the stomach seems to be wanting, and this much surprised me; but the
    fact is, that organ is simply a thin membranous sac, or rather canal,
    differing in no apparent respect from the intestine, save in slightly
    increased capacity.</p>

  <p>The musical powers of our little Blue Quit are considerable: it is
    a sweet and constant song-bird. It has various notes; frequently it
    chirps pertinaciously, like the Humming birds; at other times it utters
    a long “twee,” like the Chicken-Hawk; sometimes it delights in a soft
    warbling repetition of a single note; sometimes its voice is closely
    like the plaintive mewing of a kitten. But besides these it has a
    real song, sweet and musical. In March at Spanish Town, I heard two,
    apparently both males, warbling close together on a genip-tree opposite
    my window, very sweetly but hurriedly. When one flew to another twig
    the other presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span> followed. By and bye they ceased that melody, and
    one took to a strain consisting of about a dozen rapid repetitions
    of the same note, ending with one elevated note, with a jerking
    abruptness. This strain he repeated several times.</p>

  <p>About the middle of April, a pair of Blue Quits built a nest on one of
    the topmost branches of a high fiddle wood in the yard of Bluefields
    house. The tree was much infested with that parasite called Old man’s
    beard, large bunches of which grew on most of the limbs and boughs,
    so numerously as to touch each other in long successions. Two of
    these contiguous bunches the birds had managed to separate, either by
    picking away portions, or by pushing them apart, so as to open a large
    hollow, and in this they built a very snug domed nest. It was globular
    in form, about as large as an infant’s head, with an opening in one
    side, composed of dry grass, the dried stems of the <i>Tillandsia</i>,
    tendrils of passion-flower, bits of rag, profusely intermixed with
    cotton and the down of plants; yet these soft substances were not used
    to line the structure, the grass only appearing in the inside. Perhaps
    it was not finished, for the birds were passing in and out, and thus
    betrayed its existence, for so identified was it in appearance with the
    bunches around, that but for this ingress and egress, and the little
    opening, I could not have detected it. I sent up a lad to examine it,
    but in so doing, he partially broke the branch, causing it to hang
    down; and this I presume awakened suspicion, for the birds deserted it,
    and in a few days I had it taken down. It was empty.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

  <p>Mr. Hill has favoured me with the following interesting memorandum.
    “Feb. 5. 1838. Near the piazza of my house a cotton-bush has flung out
    its knots of white filaments. Hither come the birds at this season
    to gather materials for constructing their nests. The Blue Sparrow,
    a pretty little frugivorous bird that sings in our fruit trees, all
    the year round, its merry twittering song, has been busily engaged
    with his mate collecting bills-full of cotton. It did not seem to be a
    thing immediately settled that they should set to work and gather their
    materials at once. They had alighted on the tree as if they had very
    unexpectedly found what they were seeking. The male began to twitter a
    song of joy, dancing and jumping about, and the female, intermingling
    every now and then a chirp, frisked from stem to stem, and did very
    little more than survey the riches of the tree: at least she plucked
    now and then a bill-full of the filaments, and spreading it to flaunt
    to the wind tossed it away, as if she had been merely shewing that it
    every way answered the purpose in length and softness, and was in every
    respect the thing they wanted. At each of these displays of the kind
    and quality of the materials, the male intermingled his twittering
    song with a hoarse succession of notes, which were always the same,
    <em>chu, chu, chu, chu, chwit</em>; to which
    the female chirped two or three times in succession; then grasping
    another bill-full of cotton, tossed it away as before, and obtained
    from the male the same notes of attention and approval. At last they
    set to work in earnest, gathered a load of the materials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span> drawn out as
    loosely as they could get it, and filling their bills, started away to
    the tree, wherever it was, in which they had determined to build their
    nest.”</p>

  </div>

  <p>Intermediate between <i>C. Henslowi</i> and <i>C. passerinus</i>, the
    Tichicro differs from the former in its unspotted breast, its nearly
    even tail, the secondaries considerably short of the primaries, the
    bill arched, the deep colour of the head and the coronal streak. From
    the latter, by the tail feathers being acute, by the third and fourth
    quills being longest, and by having more chestnut on the wings. In the
    admeasurements it differs from both.</p>

  <p>This modest little bird is not common, except in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>certain localities;
    it is sometimes seen in open pastures, running on the ground, but more
    frequently in fields of guinea-grass. In a grass-piece at Peter’s
    Vale, it may be found at all times of the year, frequently rising from
    behind a tussock just before the traveller’s feet, flying a little way
    with feeble wing, and then sinking among the high grass, where it will
    remain, until one again come close to it, for it seems little inclined
    to flight. I have several times seen a single one by the sides of the
    road to Savanna-le-Mar, where it passes through the marshy flats of
    Paradise; and occasionally one frequents the pasture of Bluefields. I
    have never observed it on a tree, nor even on a bush, except on one
    occasion, early in March, when one was sitting on the log-wood fence
    at Paradise, warbling sweetly, and fearlessly continuing its song,
    though myself and two other persons stood looking at it within two
    or three yards. More frequently it utters its warbling chant sitting
    on a flat stone, or on the bare ground among the grass tufts. Its
    song is melodious, but simple; consisting of a few notes rapidly
    repeated in a single strain, <em>pettichee, pettichee,
    pettichee</em>, when it is silent for a moment, and begins again.
    This, as far as I am aware, is peculiar to the vernal season; at other
    times it has a singular call, as it skulks in its grassy coverts,
    <em>cro-cro-tichicro</em>, whence its provincial name.</p>

  <p>I have been able to learn nothing of the nidification of this Sparrow;
    its small size, sombre plumage, and retiring habits have prevented its
    obtaining much notoriety; indeed it was unknown to Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span> Hill, until I
    happened to shoot one when in company with him at St. Thomas in the
    Vale. I suspect it makes its nest in the midst of a grass tuft, or on
    the ground among them; where it would be very unlikely to be met with,
    as these tufts are never cut, nor are they eaten down by stock to
    within eighteen inches of the ground.</p>

  <p>One day in April, when the sun was pouring down his unmitigated rays, I
    observed a Tichicro walking towards a little rain-puddle in the middle
    of the road. Seeing me, however, it retired to the wayside, and did
    not fly away, though within a few feet of my horse, but stood looking
    wistfully at the puddle. I thought it had been going to drink, but as
    it began to ruffle its plumage and shake its wings, I saw that it had
    been bathing. I then rode on a few steps, leaving the pool clear, when
    it immediately ran to the edge, and walked into the shallow water,
    bending its legs and sitting down in it; then it immersed its head, and
    shook the water over its body, with the pretty action common to birds
    bathing. It seemed greatly to enjoy the relief from the heat, and only
    reluctantly left the water on the approach of another passenger.</p>

  <p>The Tichicro is certainly a perennial inhabitant of the island, and
    seems confined to the lowland districts, or to hills of moderate
    elevation.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This very beautiful Finch is rather common in the large park-like
    pastures of Mount Edgecumbe, Auchindown, Culloden, and Peter’s Vale,
    situated at the eastern extremity of Westmoreland. It is not at all
    shy, but hops about the grass, or flits to and fro among the pimento
    and orange trees, in parties of three or four, now and then sitting
    among the branches, and uttering a monotonous <em>chip, chip</em>,
    pertinaciously repeated by both sexes without variation. This is the
    only note I have heard from them.</p>

  <p>These birds are believed in Jamaica to be the descendants of some pairs
    of the common Canary turned out. “A gentleman of the colony named
    Shakspeare,” observes Mr. Hill, “many years ago, touching at Madeira on
    his voyage to this island, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>is said to have procured several male and
    female Canaries, which he set at large in the fields about the rectory
    at Black River, where they have multiplied, and have become wild
    birds of the country. Many of our grasses produce farinaceous seeds,
    extremely nutritious, and supply quite a substitute for the canary-seed
    of the African islands. I presume our birds derive their intensity of
    colour from this sort of food. They are a beautiful variety of the
    natural stock. Of their song I have never been able to learn anything
    very distinct, except that heard in the thickets with other birds, it
    sounds neither loud nor thrilling, and can barely be recognised as that
    of the bird of the aviary. It is said to have lost all its versatility
    with its power. Though these imported Canaries have increased so much,
    as to be perceptibly common, they are confined to a very small range of
    country, being observed nowhere but in the neighbourhood of the place
    where the first colony was established. A friend writes me, between
    Bluefields and Black River.”</p>

  <p>The evidence of the origin of these birds, seems thus very distinct;
    and yet the plumage is that never known to be assumed by the true
    Canary, while it agrees exactly with the Brazilian species, which,
    Spix says, “inhabits the fields of Minas Geraes, and is named Canary.”
    The plumage of the wild Canary, in its native islands, is said to be
    <em>less vivid</em> than that of caged specimens. It is possible that
    the Brazilian birds may have descended from imported birds; or, on the
    other hand, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span> the Madeira parents of ours may have been imported
    from Brazil thither; a case the more probable, from the fact of both
    being Portuguese colonies.</p>

  <p>Though hitherto undescribed, this pretty species is not rare: among the
    dark green pimento groves of Mount Edgecumbe, it may be almost always
    met with, and the contrast of its black head and yellow back, renders
    it conspicuous. Various seeds and small berries afford it food; in
    April I have seen it eagerly picking off the little crimson berries
    of the fiddlewood, and swallowing them; and in autumn I have shot one
    engaged in feeding on the seeds of the prickly-yellow tree. Probably
    grass-seed forms a part of its nutriment; late in the year when the
    guinea-grass is ripe, I have observed them flitting about from tussock
    to tussock.</p>

  <p>Its musical powers are but small. I have never <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>heard any note proceed
    from it, but <em>tsip, tsip, tseep, tēēsp</em>, loud
    and shrill, repeated at short intervals, as it hops from twig to twig.</p>

  <p>Early in June I found a nest of the Yellow-back. Over a gap leading out
    of a negro yard into the high road, at the back of Content cottage,
    hung down a dead limb of a large logwood, that was almost covered by
    bunches of <i>Tillandsia usneoides</i>. Just at the extremity of the
    depending twigs, not more than five feet from the ground, and in the
    very path frequented by the people and the animals, in the midst of a
    large cluster of the <i>tillandsiæ</i>, the Finch had constructed her
    nest. It was a neat dome, somewhat like the head-part of a cradle,
    formed of dried grass, with a few bits of white cotton interwoven, but
    profusely set on the outside with the <i>tillandsia</i>, the down of
    which gave it a very woolly appearance. It contained three eggs, white,
    splashed with dull red, having a tendency to form a crown round the
    large end. On this, as well as another occasion, the male was seen to
    enter the nest, as well as his mate, so that both probably assist in
    incubation. In the evening I went cautiously to the spot, and putting
    a gauze net suddenly before the nest, secured the female, which darted
    out into the net. Having identified her, I let her go, but in the
    morning, early, when I went again to the nest, there were no eggs
    within, but fragments of the shell of one lay on the ground at some
    little distance, which must have lain there sometime, for they were
    cleaned out by ants, and dry inside. Was this done by the female at
    finding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span> the nest desecrated? or by the male, at not finding his mate?
    for on letting the bird go in the darkness, she in her fright flew in
    the opposite direction, and perhaps did not find the nest.</p>

  <p>Immediately behind the homestead of Bluefields, a lane, confined
    for a mile or two between dry-stone walls, leads to the road which
    winds in a zig-zag line to the top of the Bluefields ridge. This lane
    possesses many attractions. By the wall on each side grow trees, which
    afford grateful shade, and many of them load the evening air with dewy
    fragrance. Orange-trees, profusely planted, give out in spring gushes
    of odour from their waxen blossoms, and in autumn tempt the eye <span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>with
    their “golden fruitage.” The Pride of China, lovely in its graceful
    leaves and spikes of lilac blossoms, and not less sweet-scented than
    the orange; the pimento, dense and glossy, with another, but not
    inferior, character of beauty; are varied by the less showy, but still
    valuable, cedar and guazuma. The various species of <i>echites</i>
    trail their slender stems and open their brilliant flowers, along
    the top of the wall, and the pretty <i>Banisteria</i> displays its
    singular yellow blossoms, or scarlet berries at its foot; while near
    the top of the lane, tangled and matted masses of the <em>night-blowing
    cereus</em> depend from the trees, or sprawl over the walls, expanding
    their magnificent, sun-like flowers, only to “the noon of night.” Here
    and there huge black nests of <i>termites</i> look like barrels built
    into the wall, whose loose stones, grey with exposure, and discoloured
    with many-tinted lichens, afford a sombre relief to the numerous
    large-leafed <i>arums</i> that climb and cluster above them. To the
    left the mountain towers, dark and frowning; the view on the right is
    bounded by a row of little rounded hills, studded with trees and clumps
    of pimento. But between the traveller and either, extend the fields
    of guinea-grass, which are enclosed by these boundary walls. In the
    autumn, when the grass is grown tall, and the panicles of seed waving
    in the wind give it a hoary surface, the little Grass-quits, both of
    this and the following species, throng hither in numerous flocks, and
    perching in rows on the slender stalks, weigh them down, while they
    rifle them of the farinaceous seeds.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span></p>

  <p>In March, I have found the stomach of the Yellow-face full of seeds of
    the common pasture grasses; and I have been struck with the enormous
    dilatation of the membranous craw, which, as in the Gallinaceæ,
    occupies the hollow of the <i>furcula</i>.</p>

  <p>D’Orbigny, who has given a good figure of it, in Sagra’s Cuba, alludes
    to its prevalence in all the great Antilles. At the Havanna, he says it
    is frequently caged, being very docile, and readily learning to sing. I
    have never heard from it any other note than a quivering chirrup as it
    flits from bush to bush.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hill has favoured me with the following note. “Nests of the
    Grass-bird are frequently brought to me, but without distinguishing
    between the yellow and the black-throated species. A nest in the
    garden, built in a <i>Nerium oleander</i>, by the latter, [in July,]
    enables me to set down a remark or two. I see no difference in the
    structure of the nests of the two species. They are both domed
    nests, made of pliable dry grass, and lined with horse-hair. This
    nest is built between the forks of the long vertical stems of the
    <i>oleander</i>, or South Sea rose. Three other vertical stems press
    it close, and the leaves quite canopy it over. The substratum of the
    nest, on which it may be said to be bedded, is a mass of long linen
    rags, wound in and round the forked branch. It is quite true that
    the Grass-bird very frequently selects a shrub, on which the wasps
    have built, fixing the entrance close to their cells. I saw a nest in
    this secure situation a few years ago; it was pointed out to me as
    illustrating a habit of the yellow-throated species.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

  <p>“The Grass-birds remind me much of the European Sparrow. They are very
    social, have a strong predilection for the house-garden, and when
    feeding by half-dozens and dozens together, are very noisy. They have a
    peculiar shrill chirp; and in the season when the grasses are in seed,
    their diminutive bodies, for they are smaller than wrens, may be seen
    weighing down the culm of the grass, everywhere about.</p>

  <p>“On one occasion, some twenty or thirty of the Yellow-throated
    Grass-bird constructed a mass of nests, within the wide crutch of a
    baobab tree, and lived in common.”</p>

  <p>Both of these birds are permanent inhabitants of Jamaica; their habits
    are so similar, that the detailed history of one will apply to the
    other. Both are quite common, and familiar; and both are unmusical: the
    present is more silent than the former; yet in spring its note may be
    heard, as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>it makes its short flights, a single harsh guttural squeak,
    difficult to indicate by words, and difficult to imitate.</p>

  <p>To the remarks of Mr. Hill’s in the preceding article, I will merely
    add the description of another nest of the Black-face, which in June
    was built between three contiguous stalks of maize, and an ear. It
    was a dome composed of slender stalks of grass and weeds woven into a
    globose form, flattened in front, on which side was the opening. The
    dried beard of the corn entered into the structure, and a small frond
    of fern, and a tendril or two of passion-flower adorned the entrance.
    Three eggs were laid, measuring ⁷⁄₁₀ by &#189; inch; pointed; white,
    splashed with dull red, chiefly at the larger end, where confluent.</p>

  <p>Of this very plain and unpretending species, but a single specimen has
    fallen into my hands; which I shot on the 9th of August 1845, hopping
    with others about logwood trees at Grand Vale. It may be a female of an
    unrecorded species, but its <span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>fawn-coloured sides distinguish it from
    the females of the preceding two species, with which in other respects
    it well agrees, as they do still more with each other.</p>

  <p>The name of <em>Quit</em> is applied without much discrimination by the
    negroes of Jamaica, to several small birds, such as the Banana Quit,
    which is a Creeper, and the Blue Quit, and Grass Quits which are

  <p>One of those gigantic and hoary cotton trees which are the pride of a
    Jamaican forest, or some other tree equally tall, is usually selected
    by this Bulfinch, for its abode. At the extremity of an immense
    horizontal limb, it builds a nest of rude materials, as large as a
    half-bushel measure, the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>opening being near the bottom. I have seen
    the bird enter this monstrous structure, but have had no opportunity
    of examining it. Dr. Robinson observes that “the Black Bulfinch builds
    a nest as big as a Blackbird’s cage, and by the artful contrivance of
    this little volatile, the whole has the simple appearance of a heap of
    trash, flung on some bough of a tree, as it were by accident, so that
    nobody would suppose it to be anything else.” And in another passage he
    records having found the nest at Negril, on the 22nd of April, 1761,
    at the summit of a Cabbage-palm, eighty-one feet high, which he had
    caused to be felled: “Among the spadices of this tree was fixed, how I
    cannot tell, the nest of the Black Bulfinch, made up of various matter;
    viz. old cane-trash fibres, silk-cotton, some dry leaves, and at the
    bottom many tendrils of climbing shrubs, and a very small species of
    <i>epidendrum</i>, or green wyth, common in this parish. In it I found
    one egg, about an inch long, in colour like that of a common duck, that
    is, of a sullied white.” (MSS. i. 72.)</p>

  <p>Mr. Hill saw one building in a vale in Clarendon in August. It had
    begun a domed nest of dried grass, rather loosely interwoven, then
    about as large as a child’s head, but probably it would have been
    larger. It was in a fork of an outer limb of a logwood tree at the edge
    of a thicket, about seven feet from the ground. The bird went and came,
    bringing materials repeatedly, while my friend was watching it.</p>

  <p>Sam maintains that he has repeatedly seen it enter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span> large cumulative
    nests, on high cotton-trees, having exactly the same appearance as
    those of the Black Shrike, (p. 190,) and that he has heard them utter
    the same remarkable cry. The suspicion was obvious, considering that
    both birds are black, and nearly of one size, that he had confounded
    the one with the other. Yet against this, I may state, that he
    is perfectly familiar with both species, that he is accustomed
    to discriminating observations, and that he asserts that it was
    impossible for him to be mistaken in one of the cases. I would add,
    that notwithstanding colour and size, the appearance of the two birds
    is very different. Yet on the 16th of June, a lad brought me a nest of
    small size and cup-like form, which he named as the nest of the “Black
    Sparrow,” and described the bird which frequented the nest, and which
    he had driven from it when about to take it, as being wholly black,
    except the throat which was red; a description which will apply to
    no other than this. Moreover, the nest was placed on a coffee-tree,
    agreeing with the fact that in some districts the species is named
    “Coffee-bird.” It is a rather deep cup, about 2&#189; inches wide in the
    clear, made of very coarse materials, such as dried and half-decayed
    leaves of trees, the long broad leaves of rushes or flags, intermingled
    with stalks of grass and herbaceous weeds, and with slender roots:
    there is a slight lining of thatch-threads, and of blades of grass torn
    into narrow strips, and arranged circularly. From such materials, it
    may be supposed that the workmanship was loose and slovenly. Three eggs
    were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span> found in it, of an elongated form, measuring 1 inch by ¹³⁄₂₀; of
    a pale glaucous white, thickly strewn with longitudinal dashes of pale
    reddish-brown, confluent at the larger end.</p>

  <p>The Black Bulfinch is said to frequent coffee trees, for the purpose of
    feeding on the ripe berries. The stomachs of such as I have examined,
    contained farinaceous seeds, comminuted into a pudding-like mass.</p>

  <p>It has a simple but rather sweet song, which may be imitated by
    rapidly pronouncing the syllables <em>wis, wis, wis,
    wis, weē</em>, the last much protracted. It can hardly be
    distinguished from the note of the Black Shrike. Early in the morning
    in spring, he delights in a rapid vibratory strain, which I can compare
    to nothing, for tone and duration, so well as to the sound produced by
    one turn of the key in winding up a musical snuff-box.</p>

  <p>One day in April, as I was riding past the cliffs at Cave, on the road
    to Savanna-le-Mar, I observed two Cotton-tree Sparrows, whose motions
    arrested my attention. They were both males in adult plumage. One
    presented himself to the other, opening his beak to the utmost; when
    the other seized something in his mouth, and tugged at it; this action
    was repeated several times, but whatever was the object pulled at, it
    appeared pretty firmly attached to the lower mandible, and refused to
    come away. From the evident desire of the one operated on, I conjecture
    that it was an application for the removal of some extraneous object
    which had accidentally stuck into the flesh of the mouth, and gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
    pain or inconvenience. But if so, how interesting an instance of
    intelligence communicated; for intelligence, and combined action, there
    certainly was. At length the operator, having done what he could, flew
    off: but the poor unsuccessful patient, after a few seconds, followed
    him, and sought him again in the bush, while I rode on my way.</p>

  <p>A male which I shot, and but slightly wounded, displayed much energy,
    and some ingenuity, in its persevering efforts to escape, in which,
    after being twice captured, it at length succeeded. When I attempted to
    seize it, it bit at me fiercely, and pinched my finger so forcibly as
    I could not have anticipated. The beak is very powerful, doubtless for
    the sake of opening or crushing hard seed-vessels.</p>

  <p>I have dissected a female at the end of April, with eggs in the ovary
    as large as pigeon-shot, the plumage of which differed from that of
    the male, only in the black being <em>not quite</em> so bright. The name
    <i>violacea</i>, is a strange misnomer, as there is not the slightest
    tinge of violet.</p>

  <p>Robinson has mentioned the prevalence of these birds on the Liguanea
    mountains, in a passage so interesting, that I quote it entire. “In
    ascending from Mr. Elletson’s estate called Merryman’s Hill, about
    four miles from Hope River plantation, after you get about a mile and
    a half beyond the said Merryman’s Hill, the air suddenly turns cool,
    and the plants and trees are entirely different from what you observed
    before, excepting two or three, which continue all the way up. There
    also you hear the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span> Black Bulfinches first begin to whistle, which are
    continued all the way up to the top of the mountains; and, indeed, they
    are the only birds you hear, for there are hardly any Nightingales;
    but they have the Grey-eyed Thrush, whose notes are not much inferior
    in sweetness but longer. In these mountains hardly any cockroaches are
    seen, but a very small kind. The wood-ant, that destructive insect, is
    also a stranger to these mountains.” (MSS. iii. 131.) By the Grey-eyed
    Thrush, I suspect he means the Glass-eye: or else the White-eyed
    Flycatcher.</p>

  <p>In the valuable drawings of the Doctor, he has one carefully executed,
    of a bird considerably larger than this, which he calls the Pied
    Bulfinch of the mountains, but which I have supposed to be the present
    bird in the partial albinism, to which all black birds seem subject.
    There are, however, some details which make this rather uncertain. The
    whole plumage, including the red gorge, (which is rather crimson than
    ferruginous) is studded with large white patches; beside which there
    is a large square spot of white, occupying the middle of the wing: the
    outmost two tail-feathers on each side are also white, and the forehead
    is pale yellow. Should it prove to be distinct, I propose for it the
    name of <i>Pyrrhula Robinsonii</i>.</p>

  <p class="p2">To these <i>Fringilladæ</i>, I would add, on the authority of Mr. Hill,
    the Rose-breasted Grosbeak of Wilson, (<i>Guiraca Ludoviciana</i>,

    still I cannot but think the bird seen by Robinson, whose description
    I give below, to be this very rare species. Of the present specimen
    the Doctor says, “This bird I saw stuffed. The legs and tail were
    wanting. It seemed less than the common Red and Blue Macaw. By what
    I can judge from this sample, this bird has never yet either been
    figured or described. Sir Henry Moore, late Lieutenant Governor, often
    assured me that the Jamaica Macaw was very different from any he had

  <p>Latham has attributed <i>Ara aracanga</i> and <i>ararauna</i> to
    Jamaica; the former on the authority of Brisson.</p>

  <p>The latter, Browne (Hist. Jam. 472,) expressly says he himself killed
    there. The Rev. Mr. Coward at present Curate of Highgate, near Spanish
    Town, informed me, that being in St. Elizabeth’s, in a plain at the
    foot of a chain of mountains dividing that parish from St. James, and
    consequently nearly in the medial line of the island, about 1842, one
    of the party called, “look! look!” and looking up, he saw two birds
    flying over-head, which he at once saw were parrots, but of very large
    size: and he was told that they were Macaws. On inquiring further of
    those resident in the neighbourhood, to whom the birds were familiar,
    he was informed that their plumage was blue and yellow. These were
    probably <i>Ararauna</i>.</p>

  <p>A letter just received from Mr. Hill, who kindly assisted my inquiries
    on the subject, says;—“I have ascertained with unquestionable
    certainty, that Macaws are occasionally, if not constantly, denizens
    of our mountain forests. They are found exclusively in the central
    mountains westward of the island, and are observed on the skirt of
    the partially cleared country, at an elevation of 2500 or 3000 feet
    above the sea. They have been surprised in small companies feeding on
    the full-eared maize, while the grain was soft, milky, and sweet, and
    the very husk was sugary. Every description I have received of them,
    makes the species to be the <i>Ara militaris</i>, the Great Green Macaw
    of Mexico. The head is spoken of as red; the neck, shoulders, and
    underparts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span> of a light and lively green; the greater wing-coverts and
    quills, blue; and the tail scarlet and blue on the upper surface, with
    the under plumage both of the wings and tail, a mass of intense orange
    yellow.</p>

  <p>“Autumnal rains set in with westerly winds in the Gulf of Mexico, when
    the Ara is said to migrate from the mountain ranges on which it breeds
    on the continent, and not to return till the turn of the year. From
    <em>our</em> birds being found only in the western parts of the island, I
    suspect that they are casual visitors, coming to us at the end of the
    year. The ordinary Parrots wing high, but the Macaws are exceedingly
    high fliers, and the command of the continental and insular shores,
    could be no difficulty to birds of their powerful, though, usually,
    not long-sustained flight. When the October rains set in, storms and
    deluges from the mountains of the continent to the west of us, send
    myriad flocks of aquatic birds over to us, and it is extremely likely
    that these magnificent Parrots are driven to our shores, where they
    find in our genial mountains, the mild quietude of the upper summer
    woods of Mexico.</p>

  <p>“A mountain district very remote, between Trelawney and St. Ann’s,
    here and there cleared and settled,—a peculiar country called the
    <em>Black grounds</em>, is said to be the never failing resort of these
    Mexican Macaws. I have been assured that several birds have been
    procured there. This is said to be nearly as far eastward as they have
    been found. Further westward, in the neighbourhood of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span> the Accompong
    Maroons, young birds, bearing the evidence of being in the first year’s
    plumage, have been procured from hog-hunters. One specimen, purchased
    from them by Mr. White, the proprietor of Oxford estate, was for some
    time the admiration and talk of the country round. I have been informed
    by those who have noticed the bird on the wing, that although the
    Macaws are never seen but flying extremely high, their great size, and
    their splendid length of tail, brilliant with intense scarlet, and blue
    and yellow, strikingly attract attention, if their harsh scream, heard
    in the hushed mountain solitudes, does not betray them. They fly from
    one ridge to another, journeying in pairs, and have been followed by
    the eye till they have alighted on the loftiest of the forest trees, in
    their chosen resting places.”</p>

  <p>The large earthy nests accumulated by the duck-ants (<i>Termites</i>,)
    around the trunk or branches of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>trees, frequently afford the Parroquet
    a fit situation for her own domestic economy. Though easily cut by her
    strong beak, the thin arches and galleries of these insects are of
    sufficiently firm consistence to constitute a secure and strong abode.
    In the cavity formed by her own industry she lays four or five eggs,
    upon the chips and dust.</p>

  <p>But the precaution of the poor bird in selecting a locality, and her
    perseverance in burrowing into so solid a structure, are not sufficient
    to ensure her safety or that of her young. The aperture by which she
    herself enters and departs, affords also a ready entrance to a subtle
    and voracious enemy, the Yellow Boa. A young friend of mine once
    observing a Parroquet enter into a hole in a large duck-ants’ nest,
    situated on a bastard-cedar, mounted to take her eggs or young. Arrived
    at the place, he cautiously inserted his hand, which presently came
    into contact with something smooth and soft. He guessed it might be the
    callow young, but hesitating to trust it, he descended, and proceeded
    to cut a stick, keeping his eye on the orifice, from which the old
    bird had not yet flown. Having again mounted, he thrust in the stick
    and forced off the whole upper part of the structure, disclosing to
    his utter discomfiture and terror, an enormous Yellow Snake, about
    whose jaws the feathers of the swallowed Parroquet were still adhering,
    while more of her plumage scattered in the nest revealed her unhappy
    fate. The serpent instantly darted down the tree, and the astonished
    youth, certainly not <em>less</em> terrified, also descended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span> with
    precipitation, and ran as if for life from the scene.</p>

  <p>The food of this species consists of various fruits and seeds. The
    fiddle-wood, burn-wood, fig, and pride of China, afford it plentiful
    and agreeable nutriment. It cuts into the plantains, both when green
    and ripe; and its fondness for the sweet and spicy berries of the
    pimento renders it the abhorrence of the planter. I have seen it on
    the top of a guava-tree holding something in its foot, which it cut to
    pieces with its beak and fed upon; probably the young fruit. When the
    prickly-yellow is in seed, the Parroquets come in flocks to eat of it;
    when they lose their wonted wariness. I have known them to resort to
    a large tree, overhanging the public road, day after day; the passing
    by of persons beneath causing little observation; generally, however,
    they would utter a screech or two, and then go on feeding. I have shot
    several individuals from this tree in succession, yet in a few minutes
    the flock would be there again.</p>

  <p>Often when mortally wounded by a shot, the grasp of the climbing feet,
    by which the bird was hanging from the twigs, becomes convulsively
    tightened, and the falling body is seen suspended head downward; for
    some minutes, often longer, it thus remains, the wings now and then
    giving an ineffectual flutter, till at last one foot relaxes its hold,
    and then the other, and the bird falls heavily to the ground. They are
    often sought for the table, and I can speak from personal knowledge to
    their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span> juiciness and flavour, especially in the pimento season.</p>

  <p>The flight of these birds is swift and rushing; in mid air they have
    a habit of suddenly deviating from the straight line of their course,
    making a sharp doubling, and then pursuing the same direction as
    before. They go in flocks, usually above the trees, and utter harsh
    screams as they fly. The sexes are precisely alike in plumage.</p>

  <p>All the Parrots are gregarious, cunning, watchful, noisy, mischievous;
    and thus are like the Monkeys. This and the following species are so
    much alike in manners and general appearance, that a description of one
    applies nearly to the other. Flocks varying from half-a-dozen to twenty
    or thirty, fly hither and thither over the forest, screeching as they
    go, and all alight together on some tree covered with berries. Here
    they feast, but with caution; on a slight alarm one screams, and the
    whole flock is on the wing, vociferous if not <span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>musical; and brilliant
    if not beautiful; particularly when the sun shines on their green backs
    and crimsoned wings. They generally prefer lofty trees, except when,
    in June, the ripe yellow plantain tempts them to descend, or when the
    black berry shines upon the pimento. Of the latter, the flocks devour
    an immense quantity, and the former they destroy by cutting it to
    pieces with their powerful beaks, to get at the small seeds.</p>

  <p>One day in January, when the pimento on the brow of Bluefields Mountain
    was about ready for picking, being full-sized, but yet green and hard,
    I observed large flocks of Black-bills and a few Parroquets, flying to
    and fro with voluble chatter, now alighting to feed on the hot aromatic
    berry, now flying off, and wheeling round to the same neighbourhood
    again. They were not at all shy, but, with unusual carelessness of
    our proximity, scarcely moved at the report of the gun which brought
    their companions to the ground. Of two which I shot on this occasion,
    I found the craws stuffed with the cotyledons of the seed alone, the
    most pungently aromatic part of the berry; the fleshy part having been,
    as I presume, shorn off by the beak and rejected. When alighted, as
    is often the case, on a dry branch, their emerald hue is conspicuous,
    and affords a fair mark for the gunner; but in a tree of full foliage,
    their colour proves an excellent concealment. They seem aware of this,
    and their sagacity prompts them frequently to rely on it for security.
    Often we hear their voices proceeding from a certain tree, or else have
    marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span> the descent of a flock upon it, but on proceeding to the spot,
    though the eye has not wandered from it, and we are therefore sure that
    they are there, we cannot discover an individual. We go close to the
    tree, but all is silent, and still as death; we institute a careful
    survey of every part with the eye, to detect the slightest motion, or
    the form of a bird among the leaves, but in vain; we begin to think
    that they have stolen off unperceived, but on throwing a stone into the
    tree, a dozen throats burst forth into cry, and as many green birds
    rush forth upon the wing.</p>

  <p>The screaming of this and the following species differs from that
    of the Parroquet, so far as to be easily distinguished. That of the
    latter consists of a series of harsh screeches, of comparative length;
    that of the Parrots is less shrill, more broken into short and rapid
    articulations, forming series of varying length, separated by momentary
    pauses. It is, in fact, much more like a hurried chattering.</p>

  <p>In some specimens, the patch of bright scarlet in the centre of the
    wing, is diminished to a slight tinge on the edge, or even entirely
    wanting. This is not a difference of sex, but probably of age.</p>

  <p>I cannot well identify our Black-bill with Latham’s “Jamaica
    Black-billed Green Parrot;” he calls it var. α of <i>Æstivus</i>, which
    it surely is not; var. δ agrees in other particulars. Ours seems, as it
    were, made up of both descriptions.</p>

  <p>The Yellow-bill is less common than either of the only two preceding,
    but its habits are the same. The same fruits supply it with food, but
    in addition, it divides the oranges, to procure the pips, and even cuts
    the acrid cashew-nut, to extract the kernel; which the others will not do.</p>

  <p>The present and the preceding species build in holes in lofty trees;
    often a hollow bread-nut is chosen, and often the capacious and
    comfortable cavity chiselled out by the Woodpecker. Four eggs are
    usually laid; and when the green feathers begin to clothe the callow
    heads of the promising family, they are too often taken by some daring
    youth, who having watched the parent to her hole, climbs the giddy
    elevation. He feeds the young with ripe plantain or banana, till they
    approach maturity, and their appetites can digest plainer food; for
    when grown they will eat almost anything.</p>

  <p>All the three species learn to speak, but the Parroquet is barely
    intelligible; the Black-bill is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>the most docile, but the beauty and
    superior size of the Yellow-bill causes it to be preferred for the
    cage. One in full plumage, and able to articulate with distinctness,
    usually fetches about twenty shillings in the towns.</p>

  <p>Robinson, in enumerating the Jamaican <i>Psittacidæ</i>, distinguishing
    them from introduced specimens, mentions in addition to those I have
    given, “the Mountain Parroquet.” (MSS. ii. 88.)</p>

  </div>

  <p>This species greatly resembles the Red-bellied Woodpecker of Wilson,
    (<i>C. Carolinus</i>,) from which it may be distinguished by the
    plumage of the rump and tail-coverts being barred as the back, and the
    tail being black, with the two middle feathers crossed by narrow bars
    of white on their inner vanes, and the outmost feathers spotted with
    white on the outer edge.</p>

  <p>This is among the commonest of Jamaican birds, being abundant in all
    situations, from the shores to the summits of the mountains. His loud
    screams as he darts along from one dead tree to another, perpetually
    betray his proximity even before we see him. Like the rest of his
    tribe, his flight consists of a series of undulations, or rather a
    succession of arcs of a circle, performed by alternate strokes and
    closures of the wings. Though rapid and rushing in its character,
    it does not extend to long distances, nor does it appear capable of
    protraction, the wings having the shortness and hollowness which mark
    a subordinate power of flight. Occasionally he alights on a horizontal
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>branch, but if so, it is lengthwise, not across, as other birds
    perch; neither does he stand up on the toes, elevating the tarsi, but
    squats down close to the wood, clinging rather than perching. Far more
    usually, however, he flies direct to the trunk, on whose perpendicular
    side he alights as suddenly as if he had been stuck there, and either
    commences rapping with his powerful beak, or hops upward till he
    finds a more promising scene of operations. If he wishes to descend,
    which he does but seldom, it is backward and in a diagonal direction;
    or sometimes he turns, so as to come down sideways, but it is never
    more than a short distance, and is performed so awkwardly, and in
    so scrambling a manner, as to indicate that he is not formed for
    descending.</p>

  <p>His food is not confined to boring larvæ; the large red ants, so
    common in the woods, I have found numerous in his stomach; and at
    other times, hard strong seeds enclosed in a scarlet pulpy skin.
    In March we sometimes find him filled with the white pulp and oval
    seeds of the sour-sop. He is said to feed on the beautiful cherries
    (<i>Cordia collococca</i>) which in brilliant bunches are ripe at the
    same season; and I have seen him engaged in picking off the pretty
    crimson berries, that hang like clusters of miniature grapes from the
    fiddlewood (<i>Cytharaxylon</i>). Sometimes he extracts the pulp of the
    orange, having cut a hole through the rind; and mangoes he eats in the
    autumn. He does damage to the sugar-cane, by chiselling away the woody
    exterior, and sucking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span> out the juice, and gets shot for this feat, by
    the owners.</p>

  <p>I have never seen the nest, but I have seen the bird go in and out of a
    round hole, far up the stipe of a dead cocoa-nut palm, where doubtless
    it was nesting.</p>

  <p>Interesting to myself, as being the first bird that I obtained in
    Jamaica, I mention the fact, because the mode in which I procured it is
    illustrative of one of its most remarkable characteristics. A day or
    two after my arrival, I was taking a ramble with a little lad, who was
    delighted to be my pioneer and assistant; we had climbed a hill which
    was clothed with large timber, so densely matted with lianes and briers
    as to be almost impenetrable. We had, however, got into the thickest
    of it, when a large and handsome bird with a long tail, beautifully
    barred with black and white, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>appeared on a low shrub within a few feet
    of us, watching our motions with much apparent interest. My little
    friend informed me that it was a Rainbird, but that it had received
    also the title of <em>Tom Fool</em>, from its silly habit of gratifying
    its curiosity, instead of securing its safety. Without wasting many
    words, however, the youth picked up a “rock-stone,” as pebbles are
    called in Jamaica, and delivered the missile with so skilful an aim,
    that the bird dropped to the ground, and became the first-fruits of an
    ornithological collection.</p>

  <p>I have often seen the bird since, and always with the same manners,
    jumping from twig to twig, or climbing with facility up the slender
    stems of the young trees, gazing at the intruder; and if driven away,
    flying only a few yards, and again peeping as before. It is little seen
    except where the woods are high, but is widely scattered on mountain as
    well as lowland.</p>

  <p>The wings are remarkably short and hollow, like those of the
    Gallinaceæ, the bird displaying the unusual phenomenon of a length
    greater than the expanse. Conformably to this, the bird is seldom seen
    to fly except from tree to tree; more usually leaping in a hurried
    manner along the branches, or proceeding up the perpendicular bole by
    short jumps. When it does fly, it glides nearly in a straight line,
    without flapping the wings. It often sits on a branch in a remarkable
    posture, the head lower than the feet, and the long tail hanging nearly
    perpendicularly downward. When sitting it now and then utters a loud
    and harsh cackle, unvarying in note, but increasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span> in the rapidity
    of its emission; and sometimes this sound is produced during its short
    flights. All the time of this effusion, the beak is held widely opened.
    It may be imitated in some degree, by repeating the syllables, <em>ticky
    ticky ticky</em>, for about a minute, as rapidly as they can be uttered.
    It is frequently seen on the ground in morasses and woods, when it
    proceeds by a succession of bounds, the long tail held somewhat high,
    the head low: the tail is jerked forward by the impulse at each pause
    of motion; and the whole action is like that of the <i>Crotophaga</i>.</p>

  <p>When held, it is fierce, trying with widely opened beak to bite, and
    uttering angry screams; the tail expanded. A male, which had been
    knocked down with a stone, but not much hurt, on being put into a cage,
    was outrageous when one’s hand was placed near the wires, dashing from
    side to side, now and then snapping at the hand, and snarling all the
    while, exactly in the tone of an angry puppy.</p>

  <p>It is extremely retentive of life; sometimes when a wounded one has
    come into my possession, I have been distressed at the vain efforts
    that I have made to deprive it of life, without absolute destruction
    of the specimen. The craw is large and protuberant, below the sternum,
    and is usually much distended. I have found in various individuals
    large caterpillars, locusts, <i>phasmata</i>, spiders, <i>phryni</i>,
    a <em>whole mouse</em>, lizards, &amp;c. Robinson found in one a large Green
    Anolis, eight inches long, coiled up in a spiral manner, the head
    being in the centre. He says it bruises the heads of lizards, and then
    swallows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span> them head foremost, and the stomach being of a roundish form,
    he conjectures that the lizard must necessarily be coiled in this
    manner. Mr. Hill had one alive for several weeks; it seized cockroaches
    and other insects, when put into its box, and ate fresh meat, if
    chopped small.</p>

  <p>I know nothing of the nest, except what the following note may
    afford. A young friend informs me that he once observed a Rainbird
    carrying “trash” into the hollow or fork of the divergent limbs of a
    logwood tree. Some little while after, passing that way, he observed
    a nest-like accumulation of similar substances, but as it was beyond
    reach, he took a long stick to poke it out. In doing so, he pushed
    out an egg, which was about as long as that of the Tinkling, but not
    so broad: its colour white with many spots, but he had no distinct
    recollection of what hue they were.</p>

  <p>“When pairing,” observes Mr. Hill, “the male bird attracts the female
    by gracefully displaying his plumage. His long graduated tail, which
    insensibly blends tints of drab-grey with black, and terminates with
    a border of white, is then seen expanded. The short rufous wings are
    spread out, and the whole plumage, from the sage-grey, hair-like,
    downy web of the back, to the soft, dull yellow under feathers, are in
    motion, as the bird endeavours by playful dalliance to win his mate’s
    attention.”</p>

  <p>The appellation of Rainbird is indiscriminately applied to both this
    and the preceding, as is, in a less degree, that of Old Man. I use
    a term by which I have heard it distinguished, in St. Elizabeth’s,
    perhaps derived from the perseverance with which it “hunts” (i. e.
    searches) for its prey.</p>

  <p>The manners of this fine bird greatly resemble those of its relative,
    and its prey is also similar. It is a bird of large size and imposing
    aspect, and its puffed plumage and long barred tail give it an
    appearance of even greater magnitude than it possesses. Its voice is
    sometimes a cackling repetition of one sound, increasing in rapidity
    until the separate notes are undistinguishable. At other times it is a
    hoarse croaking. The craw projects below the sternum, and the skin of
    that part of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>the abdomen is destitute of feathers and even of down.</p>

  <p>The obesity of this bird is often extraordinary; I have seen the fat
    lying over the bowels, between the stomach and the vent, three-fourths
    of an inch thick. When alive, it has a strong musky odour, like that of
    the John-crow.</p>

  <p>“In the changes of our mountain roads,” remarks Mr. Hill, “from deep
    masses of shadowy forest, with prodigious trees overgrown with moss,
    and climbing shrubs and lianes, to luxuriant and park-like pastures,
    flowery hedgerows and shrubby thickets,—two sounds, remarkable and
    different from each other, prevail. The one is the tapping of the
    Woodpecker, broken in its measured monotony by an occasional scream;
    and the other the rattle of the Rainbird, varied by a cry at intervals
    like the caw of the Crow tribe. The deep forest is the haunt of the
    Woodpecker,—the open thickets the resort of the Rainbird. The insects
    which form the food of the one, are those that subsist out of the
    sun-light, and perforate the alburnum of trees, or live beneath the
    bark; those that are the prey of the other, are the tribes that find
    their sustenance on the surface of vegetation, exist in the shade, and
    only resort to the open air to shift from place to place.”</p>

  <p>All our Cuckoos but the present are permanent residents; this is but a
    summer visitor. Nor is it at any time very common, a few only taking
    up their abode with us, while their brethren continue their vernal
    migration from the southern to the northern continent. In the “Notes
    of a Year,” before quoted, Mr. Hill has the following observations on
    this species. “The visit of the May-bird is one of the precursors of
    the spring rains in this island. The hazy atmosphere which precedes
    the showers of the vernal season, has already dimmed the usual lustre
    of the sky; the winds have ceased; the heat has begun to be irritably
    oppressive; the air to assume a steamy denseness, hot and heavy; the
    butterflies have left the parched and blighted pastures to congregate
    wherever they can find any kind of moisture, and the insects to attract
    the Nightjars to the lowlands, when <span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>the stuttering voice of this
    Yellow-billed Cuckoo is heard among the prognostics of the coming rain.</p>

  <p>“The May-bird, unlike the other Cuckoos with us, that never migrate,
    prefers straggling trees by the wayside to hedgerow thickets. With
    the first rain that falls, the hedge-trees, cleared of their dust,
    have begun to put forth fresh foliage, and to form those closer
    bowers favourable to the shy and solitary habits of this bird. It is
    [comparatively] long-winged, and its swift arrowy flight might be
    mistaken for that of some of the wild-pigeons. It ranges excursively,
    and flies horizontally with a noiseless speed, dropping on the
    topmost stems of trees, or descending into the middlemost branches.
    When alighting, it betrays its presence by a sound like the drawling
    <em>cuck-cuck-cuck</em> of a sauntering barn-door fowl.”</p>

  <p>One which was slightly wounded, on being put into a cage with some
    Pea-doves, began to attack them by munching out their feathers. It
    was therefore placed by itself, when it sat moody and motionless;
    attempting occasionally, however, to seize cockroaches which were put
    in to it, and biting spitefully at the hand when approached.</p>

  <p>In skinning this bird, an operation very difficult from the tenderness
    of the skin, my attention was called to a number of Entozoa, which were
    writhing about on the surface of the sclerotica of the eyes, within
    the orbit. They were very active, about half an inch long, and as
    thick as a horse-hair. Under a lens, they appeared whitish, pellucid,
    cylindrical, but tapered at each end; the intestinal canal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span> distinctly
    visible, much corrugated and in motion. There were traces of transverse
    wrinkles. Sam informed me that he had observed them once before in the
    eyes of the same species.</p>

  <p>The tawny underparts, contrasted with the sober grey of the upper,
    glossed like shot-silk, and the long tail beautifully barred with black
    and white, render the subject before us one of the handsomest of this
    genus of Cuckoos. It is a dull, and, so to speak, a stupid bird; we
    not unfrequently see it suddenly fly out from the woods, and crossing
    the road rest on a branch at a short distance, where it sits little
    disturbed by the proximity of passengers: or jumps to another twig
    near, and thence to another. I have never heard it utter a sound. It
    lives on soft insects, large spiders, &amp;c., which are stationary, and
    which it seeks by thus peeping among the trees, and for the capture of
    which long flights would be unnecessary.</p>

  <p>I know nothing of its domestic economy; but in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>January I have found
    eggs in the ovary, as large as dust-shot.</p>

  <p>The shortness of the intestinal canal, and its freedom from
    convolutions is remarkable, and struck me forcibly by comparison with
    that of a White-winged Dove, which I happened to dissect on the same
    day with this. The length of the intestine in the granivorous bird was
    forty-one inches, that in the insectivorous, ten.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In all open places, but particularly savannas and pastures which are
    occupied by cattle or horses, these birds are seen all day long, and
    all the year round. They are perhaps the most common of the birds
    of Jamaica. Familiar and impudent, though very wary, they permit a
    considerable acquaintance with their manners, while an approach within
    a limited distance, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>in a moment sets the whole flock upon the wing,
    with a singular cry, which the negroes please to express by the words,
    <em>going-awa-a-ay</em>, but which may be as well described, according
    to the fancy of the hearer, as <em>How-d’ye?</em> or <em>Anī</em>. The
    appearance of the bird in its gliding flights is unusual; the body
    is slender, the head large, and the beak enormous; and as in flying
    it assumes a perfectly straight form, with the long tail in the same
    line, without flapping the wings, it takes the aspect, on a side view,
    rather of a fish than of a bird. The centre of the upper mandible is
    hollow, and the surrounding part is composed of cells of very thin
    bone, as is the lower mandible. It thus bears a great resemblance to
    the beaks of the Toucans and Hornbills. The belly is thin and lank, and
    the bird, even though fat, has always the appearance of meagreness:
    the shabbiness of the downy feathers that clothe the belly and the
    long tibiæ, adds to this effect. In these particulars, as well as in
    general aspect and manners, the Blackbird displays a strong affinity
    to the Cuckoos and Toucans; indeed, if I may judge from a living
    <i>Rhamphastos carinatus</i> which was some time in my possession, it
    seems nearer to the latter than to the former.</p>

  <p>The food of our Blackbird, though consisting mainly of insects, is
    not confined to them. We usually find the stomach distended with
    caterpillars, moths, grasshoppers, beetles, and other insects, to such
    a degree that we wonder how the mass could have been forced in. But I
    have found these contents mixed up with, and stained by the berries of
    the snake-withe; and in July I have found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span> stomach crammed with the
    berries of the fiddle-wood, (<i>Cytharaxylon</i>,) which had stained
    the whole inner surface of a bright crimson. Flocks of these birds were
    at that time feeding on the glowing clusters profusely ripe upon the
    trees. Stationary insects are the staple food; to obtain which, they
    hop about grassy places, and are often seen to jump, or to run eagerly
    at their prey; on which occasions the long tail, continuing the given
    motion after the body has stopped, is thrown forward in an odd manner,
    sometimes nearly turning the bird head over heels. It is probably to
    protect the eyes from the stalks of weeds and blades of grass in these
    headlong leaps, that the projecting brows are furnished with a row
    of short but very stiff overhanging bristles; but what purpose was
    served by the high and thin knife-blade of a beak, I was ignorant, till
    informed by Mr. Hill, who observes that it “enables the bird to open
    out the soft earth, and seek for its insect food; it also facilitates
    its access to the vermin imbedded in the long close hair of animals. I
    am assured,” he adds, “that if a patch of cows’ dung be examined after
    Crotophagas have been searching for the larvæ of insects, it will be
    found furrowed as if a miniature plough had passed through it.”</p>

  <p>The form of this organ has given occasion, in Hayti, where also it is
    common, to the appellation of “bout de tabac,” that is “bowl of tobacco
    pipe;” it is also called there <i>Judeo</i>.</p>

  <p>The name <i>Crotophaga</i>, (tick-eater,) is no misnomer, as has been,
    without foundation, asserted by some who never saw the living bird.
    Almost every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span> one in Jamaica is aware that the Savanna Blackbird, as
    well as the Grakle, feeds on the parasites of cattle. I made particular
    inquiries about this soon after my arrival, and was assured of the fact
    by persons who had witnessed it multitudes of times, and who could not
    “mistake” the Blackbird for the Grakle, their whole form, voice, and
    motions, being different.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, however, I had repeated opportunities of personal
    observation on this point. One day I noticed a cow lying down, around
    which were four or five Blackbirds, hopping on and off her back, and
    eagerly picking the insects from her body; which service seemed in no
    wise unpleasing to her. I have also seen them leaping up on cows when
    grazing; and, on another occasion, jumping to and from a horse’s back;
    and my lad Sam has repeatedly observed them clinging to a cow’s tail,
    and picking insects from it, as far down as the terminal tuft. Had
    cattle been pastured near where I resided, I should doubtless have had
    many more ocular demonstrations: but the evidence is amply sufficient.
    In some of these cases, the occurrence was close to me, so that there
    was no possibility of deception, especially as, being aware of the
    conflicting statement, I looked with the more interest to satisfy
    myself.</p>

  <p>But stationary insects are not the only prey of the Crotophaga; in
    December, I have seen little groups of them engaged in the evenings,
    leaping up from the pasture about a yard into the air, doubtless after
    flying insects, which they seemed to catch. One day in March as I sat
    at dinner, my attention was arrested by what seemed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> a green
    bird chased by several Crotophagas, near the top of a lofty tree at
    some distance, I presently saw that it was a very large lepidopterous
    insect; it flew over the woods about a quarter of a mile before I lost
    sight of it, when it appeared to alight on the top of a tree. The birds
    did not pursue the chase far. I have seen one with a dragon-fly in its
    beak, which it had just caught, but it may have been while resting. At
    another time I saw that a Blackbird had actually made prey of one of
    our little nimble lizards (<i>Anolis</i>). These circumstances show,
    that like the Toucans, the Ani is to some extent omnivorous.</p>

  <p>Though its usual mode of progression on the ground is by hopping, or
    rather bounding, the feet being lifted together, the Blackbird is seen
    occasionally to <em>run</em> in a headlong manner for a short distance,
    moving the feet alternately. He is fond of sitting in the morning sun
    on a low tree with the wings expanded; remaining there perfectly still
    for a considerable time. In the heat of the day, in July and August,
    many may be seen in the lowland plains, sitting on the fences and
    logwood hedges with the beaks wide open, as if gasping for air; they
    then forget their usual loquacity and wariness. Often two or three will
    sit in the centre of a thick bush, overhung with a matted drapery of
    convolvolus, whence they utter their singular cry in a calling tone, as
    if they were playing at hide-and-seek, and requiring their fellows to
    come and find them.</p>

  <p>The statement that the Blackbird builds in company,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span> forming an immense
    nest of basket-work by the united labours of the flock, is universally
    maintained by the inhabitants of the colony. It is said to be usually
    on a high tree, where many parents bring forth and educate a common
    family. Mr. Hill, whose statements in Jamaican Ornithology are worthy
    of unlimited confidence, observes: “Some half-a-dozen of them together
    build but one nest, which is large and capacious enough for them to
    resort to in common, and to rear their young ones together. They are
    extremely attentive to the business of incubation, and never quit
    the nest, while sitting, without covering the eggs with leaves, to
    preserve them at an equal temperature.” The only instance in which I
    ever met with a nest, while it is not conclusive, is rather in favour
    of this opinion than the opposite. In July I found a Blackbirds’ nest
    in a Bastard Cedar (<i>Guazuma</i>); it was a rather large mass of
    interwoven twigs lined with leaves. <em>Eight</em> eggs were in the nest,
    and the shells of <em>many more</em> were also in it, and scattered
    beneath the tree. The eggs were about as large as a pullet’s, very
    regularly oval, of a greenish blue, but covered with a coating of
    white chalky substance, which was much scratched and eroded on them
    all, and which was displaced with little force. On being broken, the
    interior was peculiar; the glaire was less tenacious than usual, but
    more jelly-like, yet at the same time thinner in consistence; but
    what surprised me was, that in each egg this glaire filled at least
    three-fourths of the whole space, while the yolk, flattened in form,
    not larger in diameter than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span> a coat-button-mould, and about twice as
    thick, was adhering to one side and end. It was pale, and resembled in
    appearance that of a hen’s egg, when just turned by boiling. I examined
    several, and found all alike.</p>

  <p>I close this account with some pleasing notes of the species by Mr.
    Hill. “Though the Savanna Blackbird is classed among the scansorial or
    climbing tribe of birds, and has the yoke-formed foot,—like another
    class of the Cuckoo tribe among us, of which we have four or five
    different kinds,—it is generally a downward, not an upward climber.
    It enters a tree by alighting on the extremity of some main branch,
    and gains the centre of the foliage by creeping along the stem, and
    searching for its insect food. Unlike, however, our Cuckoos, which are
    solitary-feeding birds, it does not range from stem to stem, and search
    the tree through. The Blackbirds, moving in flocks of half-dozens,
    tens, and twelves, seldom penetrate far among the leaves. They glance
    along the branches rapidly, and silently quit the tree they have
    visited, by dropping one by one on some inviting spot on the green
    sward under them, or start away suddenly, the whole possé together, to
    some near-by thicket, to which one among them generally leads with that
    peculiar shrill and screaming cry that distinguishes them from every
    other bird of the field.</p>

  <p>“These Savanna Blackbirds are favourites with me. Other winged
    wanderers have their season, but these are the tenants of the field all
    the year round. Their life is in the sunshine. Wherever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span> there are open
    lands in tillage or pasture, with intermingled trees and shrubs, there
    these social birds frequent:—always familiar and seemingly fearless,
    but never omitting to set their sentinel watchmen to sound their cry
    when any one obtrudes nearer upon them than to a certain space within
    their social haunts.</p>

  <p>“After a passing fall of rain, one of our sudden mid-day thunder
    showers for instance, when the full burst of sunshine, bright and
    fierce, breaks again on the freshened landscape;—the first bird seen
    creeping out from the thicket to dry his wings, and regain the fields,
    is the Savanna Blackbird. The Mocking-bird, ready as he is with his
    song, to gladden the landscape once more, is seldom before the shrill
    Blackbird, in breaking the hush that succeeds the overpast shower.
    <em>Que-yuch, que-yuch, que-yuch</em> is heard from some
    embowered clump not far off, and a little stream of Blackbirds, with
    their long tails and short gliding wings outstretched in flight, are
    seen straggling away to some spot, where insect-life is stirring,
    in the fresh, damp, and exuberant earth. The sun is levelling its
    slant beam along the plains, and the sea-breeze is breathing fresh
    and fragrant with a sense of reviving moisture from the afternoon
    showers, <em>que-yuch, que-yuch, que-yuch</em> is heard
    again, hastily and anxiously repeated; and the little birds are seen
    scrambling into the hedge-rows, and the Blackbirds are pushing from
    the outer limbs of the solitary thicket, from whence they sounded
    their cry of alarm, to gain the inward covert of the leaves. A hawk
    with silent stealth is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span> skimming along the bordering woodland, gliding
    occasionally downward to the lesser bushes in the Savanna. The tocsin
    of the Blackbird, however, has warned the whole field, and not a voice
    is heard, and not a wing is stirring.</p>

  <p>“In the hot and sultry days when the dews have ceased to fall, and all
    vegetation is parched and languid, the Blackbirds are seen wending
    their way at an early hour of the afternoon to the riverside, trooping
    in little parties. They have found some spot where an uprooted tree
    has grounded in the shallow stream. Here they are perched, some tail
    upward, drinking from the gliding waters below, some silent and
    drooping, some pluming themselves, and some in the sands that have
    shoaled about the embedded trunk of the tree, washing in the little
    half-inch depths of water. They will continue here till sunset, when
    they will start off laggingly, the signal being first given by some one
    of the flock, who has announced, that it is time to seek their coverts
    for the night, with the still peculiar cry of <em>que-yuch</em>.”</p>

  <p>I am inclined to attach very little importance to the wrinkles on the
    beak as indicating specific difference: these, as well as the form and
    size of the organ, varying considerably in individuals from the same
    locality; the result, I have no doubt, of age.</p>

  <p>Of all our Doves, none is so exclusively arboreal as this. The
    Bald-pate, the Blue Pigeon, and the Ring-tail are essentially
    tree-doves, but I have seen the first feeding on the ground, and the
    second is often seen running; but all who are acquainted with this
    bird’s haunts and habits concur in affirming that he is never seen
    to put his feet upon the earth. Though it is probable that he must
    occasionally procure gravel, to aid in the comminution of his hard
    food, and that, when the resources of the wild-pines are exhausted in
    the long droughts, he must descend to drink at the mountain ponds, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>or
    gully springs, it seems that he cautiously selects his occasion, when
    unwitnessed by human eyes. And yet it is said not to be a shy bird,
    nor, at certain times, difficult to obtain by those who have made
    themselves acquainted with its habits. It inhabits the most recluse
    and dense mountain forests, where few are able to follow it, but the
    negro fowlers. The penetration of steep mountain-woods, abounding in
    prickly bushes, and tangled, beyond all description, by twining and
    pendent lianes, many of which are formidably spinous, where there is
    nothing like a pathway, and the ground is strewn with enormous masses
    of honey-combed limestone, over whose sharp points the hunter must
    often climb at the risk of his neck,—or with a loose rubble that slips
    from beneath the feet, and causes continual falls, is an enterprise
    that demands no small degree of courage, temper, and perseverance.
    The naked feet of the negroes catch hold of the rocky projections,
    almost like the hind hands of the monkey, and they can proceed with
    rapid and noiseless step; while the shoes of the white man, in his
    slow and painful progress, betray, by the displacing of stones, and
    the crackling of twigs, his approach to the wary bird, while yet far
    away. The musquitoes also, that, thirsting for blood, and swarming in
    such situations, dance around his face with their maddening hum, and
    soon inflame head, hand, and foot with their pungent stings, make a
    tyro long to be out again, almost before he has lost sight of the open
    sky of the clearing. But it is the presence of these most annoying
    insects, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span> affords an opportunity of obtaining the highly prized
    Ring-tail. This bird appears to suffer more from their stings than
    others; or else its superior sagacity has taught it a resource of which
    others are ignorant, or unwilling to avail themselves. It is aware that
    these little insect-pests cannot abide smoke, and wherever the blue
    clouds curl gracefully through the tall trees from the woodman’s fire,
    the Ring-tail is said to resort thither, if within the neighbourhood,
    and solace itself with a temporary suspension of insect assaults.
    But, alas! it is only to expose itself to a more fatal peril, for the
    negro sportsmen have marked the habit, and fail not to take advantage
    of it. Whenever they have noticed the birds feeding on the berries of
    any particular tree, they take an early opportunity of kindling a fire
    beneath it, near which they conceal themselves, so as to watch the
    tree. The birds begin to arrive, and are shot down by the fowler one
    after another; the repeated flashes and reports, and the falls of their
    companions, driving the survivors away for a few moments only from the
    attractive spot, to which they again and again return till the gunner’s
    ambition is satisfied. They are frequently brought to Kingston,
    Savanna-le-Mar, and the other towns, and are eagerly purchased for the
    table; though, as the distance which they are carried usually prevents
    their arrival on the day they are killed, they are almost invariably
    deplumed and drawn, and the inside strongly peppered before they are
    sent to market. Hence specimens for the naturalist, are to be obtained
    only by a special expedition. Of the three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span> superlative delicacies of
    which the natives of Jamaica boast, the Ringtail holds the undisputed
    pre-eminence. The others are the Fresh-water Mullet, and the Black
    Land-crab. Dr. Chamberlaine (Comp. to Jam. Alm. 1840) mentions this
    bird as “the most luscious dainty of his class, or of any other. I am
    acquainted,” he further observes, “with no bird that the sportsman
    pursues, that can be compared to the Ring-tail Pigeon, for the
    richness, the delicacy, and the tenderness of his flesh. He is, during
    the months of September, October, and November, a mass of luscious fat,
    and his plump and well-enveloped flesh acquires for him a superiority
    over that of all his tribe.” It is a common thing, at the period of
    their high condition, for birds shot from a tall tree to burst asunder
    with the fall.</p>

  <p>The Ring-tail is stated invariably to perch near the middle of a tree,
    usually in the fork of the principal limbs; where, when seated, it will
    remain quietly looking down at the fowler, perhaps within a few yards
    of his head. The centre of those trees which are clothed with a dense
    tangled mass of withes or creepers, is preferred; and it is asserted
    that on no occasion is this bird to be seen perched on an exterior twig
    or branch. The Blue Pigeon sometimes manifests the same predilection;
    but with him it is only when the gusty “norths,” rocking the flexible
    branches, would make his seat on them uncomfortable if not insecure.</p>

  <p>The Ring-tail will sometimes leave his solitudes, and come down to eat
    the berries of missletoe, growing on sour-sop and other trees. A friend
    has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span> seen four thus engaged on a tree in the house-yard. It eats the
    seed of the yam also in the provision ground.</p>

  <p>When the vernal rains have copiously descended, the “negro-yam” sends
    out plentifully its young and tender shoots: the tips of these, with
    the unopened leaves and buds, are particularly agreeable to this
    exquisite bird, and it may often be shot at that season in the grounds
    of the mountain slopes. It is, however, then in poor condition.</p>

  <p>By an Act of the Colonial Legislature, 10 Ann. xvi. 3, wild pigeons
    were forbidden to be killed in the parishes of St. Catherine or St.
    John’s, or on any island or kay, in the months of May, June, and July,
    under a penalty of forty shillings, or slaves to have thirty-nine
    lashes. Since the abolition of slavery, this, as well as many other
    laws, of similarly oppressive character, has been repealed.</p>

  <p>Robinson found in one, the hard perforated seeds of the small
    palmetto-thatch. He mentions also, that in the autumn they owe their
    fatness to feeding on the fruit of the trumpet-tree, wild-raspberries,
    and wild star-apples. “It is remarkable,” he observes, “that the thighs
    [tibiæ?] are twice the length of the legs [tarsi?].”</p>

  <p>The unwonted absence of the seasonal rains in the spring of 1846,
    rendered my efforts to obtain specimens of this fine bird fruitless,
    though I sent experienced persons many times to their usual haunts.
    I am therefore compelled to give a description from Dr. Robinson’s
    MSS. The preceding accounts, also, are the results, not of personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
    observation, but of careful and minute and repeated inquiries. Mr. Hill
    writes me that it has been abundant on the Highgate mountains since my
    departure.</p>

  <p>Temminck asserts that the Ring-tail seems to be spread over the whole
    Antilles and <em>Bahamas</em>, but is not aware that it exists on the
    continent. Mauge found it at Porto Rico, where it is said to associate
    in flocks of many hundreds. (!)</p>

  <p>The Blue Pigeon is found both on the mountains and in the lowlands.
    On the former it seems less to affect the deep forest, than such
    woods as skirt cultivated ground. When the purple berries of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span><i>phytolacca</i> are ripe, about the end of the year, these pigeons
    flock in considerable numbers to feed at dawn and at evening. About
    the same time they are numerous in the lowlands, for I have found
    them plentiful in the large morass that extends along the shore from
    Crabpond to Parker’s Bay. They were flying about in pairs, for the
    most part, among the black mangrove trees, on whose seeds they were
    probably feeding. But I found in the stomachs of those which I shot,
    the white blossoms of a species of missletoe which is abundant there,
    and in one the bean-like seeds of, as I believe, the madjo-bitter
    (<i>Picramnia</i>). Early in February I visited the mangrove woods of
    Mount Edgecumbe morass, to seek these birds. They were rather numerous,
    but alighted only on the summits of the tallest trees. Finding that
    they were very shy, I seated myself and remained quietly watching. Thus
    I obtained several successive shots, as they appeared to come round to
    the spot periodically, perhaps once in half-an-hour. Two or three were
    in company, and as they flew from tree-top to tree-top, their movements
    were announced by a guttural <em>jug, jug</em>, and by the loud
    rushing of their powerful wings. Frequently one would chase another
    round the trees, playfully, which I conjectured to be a symptom of
    pairing.</p>

  <p>The common note of the Blue Pigeon resembles somewhat the barking of
    a cur; <em>bow-wow—wōw</em>, the last syllable protracted and
    falling. It is much like the <em>Sary-coat-blue</em> of the Bald-pate,
    but the short second syllable is wanting.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span></p>

  <p>For delicacy and flavour of flesh this species scarcely yields to its
    congener, and is but a little less in request. It is dark in hue, but
    exquisitely delicious, tender, juicy, and free from bitterness.</p>

  <p>It is an arboreal bird, but not quite so exclusively as the Ring-tail.
    Like the Bald-pate, he is often shot, by forestalling him at his
    feeding tree, before day-break. In form he agrees with the bird just
    named; his legs and feet are stout and strong; his head and neck
    small and slender; the plumage of his nape forms a sort of ridge. M.
    Temminck, probably having never seen the bird alive, and not being
    aware of the very singular peculiarity of the iris mentioned in the
    note, has given his figure red eyes. The two colours impart a very
    unusual character to the physiognomy of the species; it is constant,
    not accidental.</p>

  <p>About the end of April, I was informed of a Blue Pigeon’s nest on a
    lofty limb of an inaccessible cotton tree. It was a more substantial
    structure than those of its congeners, being made of dried grass,
    or similar material, as well as twigs. A Bald-pate had a nest on
    a contiguous tree, and the neighbouring birds were continually
    squabbling. I have never seen the eggs.</p>

  <p>The Blue Pigeon is said to inhabit not only all the great islands of
    the West Indies, but also Guiana.</p>

  <p>This fine dove is common in almost all situations, but chiefly affects
    the groves of pimento, which generally adorn the mountain pens. The
    sweet aromatic berries afford him abundant and delicious food during
    the pimento season; the umbrageous trees afford him a concealment
    suited to his shy and suspicious character; and on them his mate
    prefers to build her rude platform-nest, and rear her tender progeny.
    Wary exceedingly, the Bald-pate, from his seat among the topmost twigs,
    discerns the gunner, himself unseen, and intimates his vicinity only
    by the rushing of his strong wings, as he shoots off to some distant
    part of the grove. In the breeding season, however, when alarmed from
    the nesting tree, he does not fly far, and soon returns; so that the
    sportsman, by concealing himself, and watching the bird’s return, may
    bring him down. When the pimento is out of season, he seeks other
    food; the berries of the sweetwood, the larger ones of the breadnut,
    and burn-wood, of the bastard cedar, and the fig, and the little ruddy
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>clusters of the fiddle-wood, attract him. He feeds early in the
    morning, and late in the afternoon: large numbers resort to a single
    tree, (though not strictly gregarious,) and when this is observed, the
    sportsman, by going thither before dawn, and lying in wait, may shoot
    them one by one, as they arrive. In September and October they are
    in fine condition, often exceedingly fat and juicy, and of exquisite
    flavour. In March the clammy-cherry displays its showy scarlet racemes,
    to which the Bald-pates flock. The Hopping Dick, Woodpecker, and
    Guinea-fowl, feed also upon it. In April, Sam tells me he has seen as
    many as thirty, almost covering a tree, feeding on berries which he
    believes were those of the bully-tree. Late in the year they resort to
    the saline morasses, to feed on the seeds of the black-mangrove, which
    I have repeatedly found in the craw; I have even seen one descend to
    the ground beneath a mangrove, doubtless in search of the fallen seeds.
    In general, however, the Bald-pate is an arboreal pigeon, his visits to
    the earth being very rare. He often feeds at a distance from home; so
    that it is a common thing to observe, just before nightfall, straggling
    parties of two or three, or individuals, rushing along with arrowy
    swiftness in a straight line to some distant wood.</p>

  <p>The Bald-pate is a noble bird; plump, yet of a graceful form; the
    iridescent scale-like feathers of his neck, with their black borders,
    are very striking: he is staid and sedate in manners, when sitting,
    and there is something of supercilious sternness in his countenance,
    which, combined with his snow-white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span> head, always reminds me,
    strange as the comparison may appear, of the grand Bald-Eagle. His
    coo is <em>Sary̆-coat-blūe</em>, uttered with much energy, the second
    syllable short and suddenly elevated, the last a little protracted and
    descending.</p>

  <p>Incubation takes place chiefly in the months of June and July. In
    Bluefields morass many nests are found on the tallest black-mangroves,
    and are much robbed by the negro youths, who rear the young for sale:
    the native pigeons being, more than any other birds, kept in cages by
    the Creoles. The nest is merely a very slight platform of dry twigs,
    rudely attached, on which two eggs are laid. They are of delicate
    whiteness, in form very regularly oval, and in dimensions 1&#189; inch by
    1¹⁄₁₀. I never heard of its breeding on rocks.</p>

  <p>I add a few particulars of some which I kept from early age. I shot
    a young one on the 2nd of September, breaking the tarsus; and about
    a week afterwards another was brought me which may have been rather
    older. The former appeared not to have finally left the nest. Both were
    exceedingly ugly; long-necked, thin-bodied, the head not well rounded,
    the fleshy part of the beak prominent, and its base unfeathered. The
    whole plumage was blackish ash-coloured, each feather slightly tipped
    with paler, and the feathers of the head terminating in little curled
    grey filaments, which added to the uncouth appearance of the birds. In
    a week or two I perceived these filaments were gradually disappearing,
    and about the beginning of October the small feathers began to clothe
    the base of the beak:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span> these feathers were greyish-white, and at the
    same time the grey hue was beginning to spread up the forehead, I
    believe by the dropping of the black feathers, and their immediate
    replacement by the white ones. About this time also the general plumage
    began to assume the blue hue of the adult, in patches; and on the 12th
    of October, I first observed the beautiful iridescent feathers of the
    neck, but as yet only on one side. These notes refer to the elder; the
    other was about two weeks more backward. On the 16th, I first heard
    it coo; for some time it had now and then uttered a single note, but
    on this day it gave the whole <em>Sary̆-coat-blūe</em>, but short, and
    in a low tone; and that only once. By the end of November the white
    had spread over the whole crown as in the adult, but was not yet so
    pure or so smooth. A third, which I purchased in November, though a
    young one of the season, having been reared from the nest, was much
    more mature both in plumage and size. By the end of that month the
    crown of this one was <em>perfectly</em> in the adult plumage, the neck
    feathers complete on both sides, the body plump and smooth. This
    individual, when first put into the cage, was very cross, pecking at
    all the others, including some Pea-doves, whenever they came near him,
    and even stretching himself down from his perch to reach them as they
    walked under him. One or two of the Pea-doves suffered particularly,
    for he munched out their feathers by mouthfuls, laying bare a large
    portion of their backs. He soon became more reconciled, but never
    associated with them, never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span> descending from his perch all day, except
    to feed or drink. The other Bald-pates walked about a good deal with
    the Pea-doves, and were rather playful. Any new object they would
    examine and lay hold of. Their cage, a capacious packing-box, was lined
    with paper; somehow or other, a bit of it was torn up; the Bald-pates
    were continually pulling at this, and were not content till they had
    stripped off a large space. A hole in the gauze front had been darned
    with thread; they would take the loose ends in their beaks and tug at
    them. Sometimes they would seize a stick or twig, and drag it about
    the cage. A White-belly, taken in a springe, and put with them, would
    not eat the Indian corn, with which they were fed, and was supplied
    with orange-pips: the Bald-pate would run up to the White-belly when
    feeding, and playfully endeavour to snatch the pips from him as he
    picked them up; when, however, he succeeded in getting possession of
    one, he immediately dropped it: it was only the fun he wanted. If I
    inserted my finger through the gauze, he would seize it with his beak,
    and, as it were, <em>chew</em> it, and tug at it in various directions,
    turning, and sometimes quite inverting, his head. He would always take
    a grain of corn from my hand, even if he did not eat it.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the year, all of my Bald-pates used to coo
    frequently, and, what is strange, often in the night. When wakeful from
    sickness, I have heard it from the adjoining room at intervals, four
    or five times during the night: especially on those nights in January,
    when the furious <em>norths</em> blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span> with so much violence; the bird
    probably awakened or made uncomfortable by the cold and howling gusts
    that penetrate every room, as if they would “blow the house out of the
    windows.” On each occasion the whole set of syllables was repeated
    twice or thrice in quick succession, preceded by a low note, and then
    the former silence was maintained. The imitation of their coo, which
    may be very accurately effected, always attracted attention from the
    birds, manifested by their eyes turned towards the sound, and their
    necks stretched out.</p>

  <p>This is a Turtle of much elegance. Its general aspect resembles that of
    the Pea-dove, but its colour is less warm, and its figure less plump.
    The singular <span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>white band on the wing is at any distance a sufficient
    distinctive mark. It is the only gregarious Dove we have; for the small
    companies of the Ground Dove can hardly entitle it to be so called: the
    Whitewing, however, associates in flocks of twenty or thirty, which,
    when removing, fly in a body, as do tame Pigeons. In the early months
    of the year, when the physic-nut (<i>Jatropha curcas</i>) is ripening,
    and oranges come in, the Whitewing becomes plentiful in open pastures,
    and the low woods in the neighbourhood of habitations; the seeds of
    these fruits, and the castor-oil nut, forming the principal part of
    their food. At this time they are very easily shot, as they walk about
    on the ground. They are also taken very readily in springes, and in
    traps called <i>calambans</i>, baited with orange seeds. Sometimes when
    the foot is caught in the springe, the bird will remain very quietly;
    at others it struggles much, so as almost to be deplumed: cats often
    find them, and leave little but feathers to the owner. Occasionally the
    bird is caught by the neck, and I have been told of an instance, in
    which a Whitewing taken thus, flying with impetuosity on the alarm, cut
    its head absolutely off with the string, the body falling one way and
    the head another. From the ease with which they are procured, they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>are
    a good deal eaten, though seldom fat, and rather subject to be bitter.</p>

  <p>When the rains fall, we see the Whitewings but seldom; they betake
    themselves to the deep woods and impenetrable morasses, when their
    presence is indicated by their loud stammering coo. The full coo
    consists of more notes than that of any other of our Doves; rendered
    into negro-English, it runs thus: “<em>Since poor Gilpin die, cow-head
    spoil</em>,” the last note protracted and falling meaningly. This,
    however, is not uttered, as far as my experience goes, when coming out
    into “the open” to feed. Two which I had with other Doves, caged, were
    usually silent; but in Mr. Hill’s larger collection, the Whitewings
    were most pertinaciously vociferous. All the day long, the four-fold
    coo, “<em>two bits for two</em>” or “<em>what’s that to you?</em>” loud
    and vehement, saluted our ears. Sometimes it was replaced by a sort of
    chorus, more musical, “<em>toora-loora, toora-loora</em>.” The
    other Doves cooed occasionally, but the Whitewings incessantly.</p>

  <p>The food of this Pigeon, when retired from view, I am not acquainted
    with; it is probably the seeds and berries which supply its congeners.
    The seed of the sour-sop is perhaps agreeable to it, for one of my
    lads once caught a Whitewing by bird-lime set for Blue Quits at a ripe
    sour-sop. Farinaceous and pulpy berries are found in the woods at all
    seasons, so that the Pigeons and other frugivorous birds have not
    only abundance but variety. Its nest is not very often met with. I am
    informed that it occasionally builds in a pimento; Robinson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span> says that
    it builds also in the orange, and sea-side grape, in May, a very slight
    and narrow platform of rude twigs, and lays two eggs, of a pale drab
    hue.</p>

  <p>The general form, the shortness of the tarsus, the length of the tail,
    and its manners, associate this species rather with the arboreal than
    the terrestrial Doves. It, however, approaches the latter. Those which
    I kept in a cage, habitually rested on the highest perches, while the
    Pea-doves generally rested on the floor.</p>

  <p>The Whitewing is swift and strong on the wing; but its flight is not
    accompanied with that peculiar whistling, produced by the wings of the
    Pea-dove.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The open pastures, or the grassy glades of pimento pens, are the
    favourite haunts of this pretty Dove, where it walks on the ground
    singly or in pairs. In such open situations, it can discover, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>mark
    the motions of an intruder, and long before he is within gun-range it
    is upon the wing. Few birds are more difficult of approach, unless the
    intervention of a wall or a thick bush permit a concealed access. Its
    flight is rapid and forcible, and performed with a peculiar whistling
    of the wings, by which it is at once recognised, though unseen.</p>

  <p>The Pea-dove is frequently seen in the middle of dusty high-roads, but
    whether they resort thither for the purpose of dusting, or to procure
    gravel, I cannot say, as they usually fly as soon as seen. When the
    rains have ceased, the increasing drought renders these, as it does
    many other birds, more familiar; and they may be seen lingering on the
    borders of streams and ponds. Indeed they seem, of all our Doves, to
    haunt most the vicinity of water; particularly those dreary swamps or
    morasses which are environed by tall woods of mangrove. In the winter
    months, when the pastures are burnt up with drought, we may hear all
    day long their plaintive cooing, proceeding from these sombre groves,
    though it is not much heard in any other situation. The coo consists of
    five deliberate notes, loud but mournful, “<em>Sary-coat-true-blue</em>,”
    all in the same tone, save the second, which is short and elevated. It
    resembles the note of the Carolina Dove.</p>

  <p>The Pea-dove subsists on various fruits and seeds: pimento-berries,
    orange-pips, sop-seeds, castor-oil nuts, physic-nuts, maize, and the
    smaller seeds of pasture weeds are some of his resources. His flesh is
    white and juicy, and when in good condition is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span> in general estimation.
    His form is plump, and his plumage beautifully smooth; though its
    colours are sober, they are chaste and pleasing; and the aspect of his
    countenance, with his dark liquid eye, is remarkably engaging.</p>

  <p>I kept several of these birds in a cage for nearly a year, but they
    were too timid to be interesting in confinement. They could not bear
    any approach to them, without fluttering violently. They were very
    restless, walking rapidly about the cage-floor all day long, invariably
    walking over each other, rather than deviating from their course.
    Only one or two habitually perched. The Pea-dove has the habit of
    jerking the head by quickly shortening, and then lengthening the neck,
    immediately and invariably followed by a flirt upward of the tail;
    this action my captives were perpetually performing at intervals of a
    few seconds, when not walking. They slept on the floor of the cage,
    but were extremely wakeful. I have many times crept silently into the
    room at various hours of the night, taking off my shoes and moving with
    extreme caution, but always found them wide-awake; perhaps sensible of
    the light of the candle, even when the eyes were closed. My servant,
    however, found them asleep very early one morning, when they awoke with
    a start: the head was not behind the wing.</p>

  <p>They were jealous of other birds, and, notwithstanding their gentle
    physiognomy, irritable and pugnacious. A Cashew bird that was a
    fellow-prisoner, they would strike at with the wing, and even if I
    myself suddenly approached, the wing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span> was raised in defence. They were
    spiteful towards an unoffending Kildeer Plover, pecking at him so
    violently as to pull the feathers from his side, and make him cry out.
    I fed them with maize.</p>

  <p>I have now in my possession a Pea-dove, shot by Sam in December, the
    lower mandible of which is distorted by the point being turned on one
    side, so that the mandibles cross as in the Cross-bill. The tips,
    however, could be brought into contact. It was shabby in plumage, and
    in very poor condition, the cause of which was obvious, for, open the
    plumage of the under parts wherever I would, the body was swarming
    with lice (<i>Nirmus</i>); and <em>a large proportion</em> of the body
    feathers were crowded with nits to such a degree, that <em>on one
    feather</em> which I placed under a lens I counted upwards of 170; and
    there were other feathers more crowded than this. I judged it to be a
    moderate estimate, that on this unfortunate bird there were not less
    than 500 lice, and 10,000 nits. On one of the thighs, where they were
    very thick, there was an ulcer. In addition to this, two large bird
    flies (<i>Ornithomyia</i>) flew from the plumage, while I was examining
    it.</p>

  <p>The nest is, as usual, a loose platform of twigs interlaced, with
    scarcely any hollow, and no leaves; it is often built in an orange,
    or a pimento, and contains two eggs of a drab hue. Near the end of
    March we started a Pea-dove from the centre of a lofty Ebby palm
    (<i>Elais</i>) in Mount Edgecumbe; it immediately alighted on the
    ground just before my lad, and began to tumble about in a grotesque
    manner, affecting inability to fly. Sam was not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span> be caught, however;
    but calling my attention to the circumstance, we began to peer among
    the fronds of the tree, where we presently discerned the projecting
    ends of the twigs that constituted her nest, the centre of her fears
    and anxieties. It was inaccessible, however, when discovered.</p>

  <p>Though it would be scarcely proper to term this little bird gregarious,
    it is certainly social, being rarely seen alone. In pairs or small
    companies of three or four, it frequents pastures, on the short turf
    of which it runs with considerable speed; and is rather loath to take
    wing, often allowing a person to approach within a few yards. If one
    fly, however, all fly; but seldom go far; alighting either on the
    ground again, or on some neighbouring tree of small elevation. As it
    runs along, the tail is usually erected, which gives it the aspect of a
    miniature fowl.</p>

  <p>I have found the craw full of small seeds of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>grasses; they also eat
    the seeds of the <i>Jatropha</i> and of the castor-oil plant, and
    particularly those of the gamboge-thistle, (<i>Argemone</i>,) so common
    in pastures. They are fond of picking about the beds of shallots and
    escalions, for minute seeds exposed in the newly-turned earth. They
    are, therefore, readily taken in springes made of horse-hair; they are
    more commonly caught by the neck than by the feet, and not seldom, as I
    am assured, is the neck quite cut off; though I presume the springe in
    such cases must be of stronger material.</p>

  <p>The Ground-dove is numerous all the year round. In March, I observed
    it particularly abundant on the banks of the Rio Cobre, especially on
    a flat gravelly bed, partially surrounded by the bending stream near
    Spanish Town. The boys of the neighbourhood took advantage of the
    thirsty birds’ resort to the water, by strewing about the spot the
    seeds of the cockspur, (<i>Pisonia aculeata</i>); a burr so adhesive,
    that if one touch but a feather, it is immovable; a very little
    struggling entangles other feathers, and the bird is utterly helpless.
    So firmly tenacious is the hold, that even when the bird is in the
    hand the seed can be removed only by plucking away each feather it has
    touched. Many are caught by this singular artifice.</p>

  <p>It is very easily deprived of life. I have known one fly into a room,
    and, striking its head against the ceiling, fall down and die in an
    instant.</p>

  <p>From April to June the low woods resound with the coo of this little
    Dove. Sometimes it resembles the word <em>meho?</em> in an interrogative
    tone, loud,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span> querulous, and pertinacious in iteration. At others it is
    like children calling <em>whoop</em>. It is not at all plaintive in its
    character.</p>

  <p>There is a singular projection on the outline of the inner web of the
    fourth primary, in this genus, and more slightly on that of the fifth.
    The object of this peculiarity it is not easy to conjecture.</p>

  <p>Dr. Robinson, having weighed one, records the weight as one ounce
    sixteen grains, troy. He mentions also, what I have not seen, that
    “the irides consist of, first, one ring of yellow, then one of black,
    a narrower of black, and another of yellow, broader.” (MSS. ii. 97.)
    Wilson’s description appears to me to have been taken from a preserved
    skin.</p>

  <p>This lovely Pigeon is chiefly confined to the upland districts; where
    its loud and plaintive cooing <span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>makes the woods resound. The negroes
    delight to ascribe imaginary words to the voices of birds, and indeed
    for the cooings of many of the pigeons, this requires no great stretch
    of imagination. The beautiful Whitebelly complains all day, in the
    sunshine as well as the storm, “Rain-come-wet-me-through!” each
    syllable uttered with a sobbing separateness, and the last prolonged
    with such a melancholy fall, as if the poor bird were in the extremity
    of suffering. But it is the note of health, of joy, of love; the
    utterance of exuberant animal happiness; a portion of that universal
    song wherewith “every thing that hath breath may praise the Lord.”
    The plumage, as usual in this family, is very soft and smooth, the
    expression of the countenance most engagingly meek and gentle. And it
    is a gentle bird: I have taken one into my hand, when just caught in
    a springe, full grown and in its native wildness; and it has nestled
    comfortably down, and permitted its pretty head and neck to be stroked,
    without an effort to escape, without a flutter of its wings.</p>

  <p>This is one of those species which habitually live on the ground: in
    unfrequented woods, as well those which are open, as those which are
    choked with underwood, the Whitebelly walks about singly or in pairs
    picking up various seeds. About Content,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span> a densely wooded mountain
    side, it is very numerous in June and July, feeding on sop-seeds, and
    many are taken in springes. The physic-nut forms a large portion of its
    food; as well as orange-pips; and fragments of the large seeds of the
    mango, chewed by hogs. Its flesh is generally esteemed; it is white,
    juicy, and well-flavoured, without being liable to bitterness.</p>

  <p>As it walks to and fro, it frequently flirts the head and tail, but not
    so markedly as the Pea-dove. If flushed, it betakes itself to a low
    tree not far off, whence, if unmolested, it is soon down again. Often
    when seen in the woods, it runs a few yards, and then rises to fly, but
    as if trusting less to its powers of flight than to those of running,
    alights again immediately, and runs swiftly off among the bushes. It
    has no regular roosting-place, often spending the night on a stone,
    or a log, or a low bush that happens to be near the spot where it was
    feeding at nightfall. This is not the case with the other Doves.</p>

  <p>The aspect and air of the Whitebelly are unlike those of its kindred.
    Its round head, the prevalence of light hues, and its height upon the
    legs, contribute to this peculiarity. Essentially a ground-pigeon, its
    length of tarsus enables it to run with ease and celerity; perhaps more
    rapidly than any other of the family.</p>

  <p>Unlike the tree-doves, the Whitebelly usually builds in rather a
    low situation; often a logwood, a favourite tree with this, and the
    Whitewing. If in the large woods, one of moderate height is chosen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
    The nest consists of a few loose sticks, with some leaves in the
    centre; the eggs are white.</p>

      flesh colour, front of tarsi and of toes, pink, claws blackish, small
      and blunt. Head high and sub-conical; feathers of occiput projecting
      and overhanging the neck, as if a notch had been cut with scissors;
      or still more, as if the head were covered with a hood which hung
      down behind. Forehead blackish grey, softening into a brownish tint
      behind: below the eye and ear is a large undefined patch of buff;
      chin of same hue; the rest of head, throat, neck, breast, and belly,
      bluish-grey; the whole neck richly glossed with pale crimson, changing
      to brassy-green, especially behind, where the feathers meet in a sharp
      ridge. Abruptly separated from the neck, a broad belt of dark red
      extends from each shoulder across the back, reflecting the richest
      purple. The remainder of back, rump, tail, and wing-secondaries and
      tertiaries, deep-sea-green, or black, according to the light, glossed
      with rich purple: on the secondary and primary coverts, the green
      merges into a dark bistre: primaries bright chestnut, with black shafts
      and tips. Inner surface of wings, thighs, lower belly, vent and under
      tail-coverts, chestnut.</p>

  <p>No description can give an adequate notion of the lustrous radiance
    of this most lovely bird; though it has not yet found a place in our
    Ornithologies. I presume it to be the “<i>Columba silvatica major
    nigro-cærulescens</i>,” of Browne’s Jamaica, p. 468, but he has given
    no description; his “Mountain Witch, Mountain Partridge, or Mountain
    Dove,” is doubtless the bird described in the following article. Mr.
    Selby, in his beautiful volume on the Pigeons, in the Nat. Lib.,
    named, without characterising, the genus <i>Geophilus</i>, which,
    while he <span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>applied it with confidence to <i>Carunculatus</i> and
    <i>Nicobaricus</i>, he assigned doubtingly to the larger ground doves
    of Cuba and Jamaica. But these species have no generic identity; nor if
    they had, could this name be adopted, as it had been previously used
    for a genus of <i>Myriapoda</i>.</p>

  <p>This magnificent bird inhabits the most retired mountains, and the
    deepest woody glades there; places difficult of approach and rarely
    traversed. In the dense and lofty forest that clothes the brow of
    Bluefields Peak, it is very numerous, usually seen singly or in pairs,
    walking on the ground; the freedom of the forest there from underwood
    allowing it to exercise its fleetness of foot to advantage. If alarmed,
    it generally seeks to escape by running, its bulk and shortness of wing
    rendering its flight burdensome and ineffective. Its coo consists of
    two loud notes, the first short and sharp, the second protracted and
    descending with a mournful cadence. At a distance its first note is
    inaudible; and the second, reiterated at measured <span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>intervals, sounds
    like the groaning of a dying man. These moans, heard in the most
    recluse and solemn glens, while the bird is rarely seen, have probably
    given it the name of Mountain Witch.</p>

  <p>About a score yards from the high road, just opposite Bluefields gate,
    is a house lately occupied, but now deserted; the space between it
    and the road is now overgrown with young trees sprung up with the
    luxuriance of tropical vegetation, and is already a wilderness. Among
    the bushes, the castor-oil plant and the physic-nut are numerous; and
    under these in the dry season, the Whitewings assemble in search of
    seeds. One day in November, Sam had gone thither to set a springe, when
    he was surprised by the sight of a Mountain Witch on the ground almost
    close to him. He had, the moment before, discharged his gun, and it
    shows the fearlessness of this beautiful bird, that it had not flown at
    the report. Immediately on the discovery, the lad drew back to re-load,
    but before he could accomplish this, the bird began to run, and was
    presently lost among the bushes. On several successive days it was
    seen at the same spot, invariably on the ground; generally it allowed
    a very close approach, running when the lad advanced, but stopping to
    gaze if he stopped. As it stood it was observed to jerk the tail in the
    manner of the Pea-dove. At length Sam shot it. It was a young bird,
    rather smaller in size and less iridescent than the adult. Its craw was
    full of castor-oil nuts, and contained also a little snail. This is
    the only instance, I ever heard of, in which this species<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span> came down
    to the lowlands: it was seen chiefly in the evening, and its object so
    far from its mountain home, was probably the search after water, the
    weather being very dry.</p>

  <p>The relation which the development of the power of flight or of
    walking, bears to the colour of the flesh, is well shown by a
    comparison of this species with the Bald-pate or Blue Pigeon. The flesh
    of the tree dove is dark red; that of the Mountain Witch is whiter than
    a chicken’s: the former the more juicy, the latter tender, but dry;
    both are delicious in flavour.</p>

  <p>Various seeds and nuts I have found in the gizzards of many that I have
    examined, some hard and stony; others farinaceous, and comminuted. The
    seed of the lance-wood is said to afford it food.</p>

  <p>The Mountain Witch is generally spoken of as rare, in the island;
    but I suspect the remoteness and difficulty of access of its recluse
    solitudes, have contributed to this opinion. Robinson gives Clarendon
    as one of its localities: he says it is the most beautiful pigeon in
    Jamaica. I should be inclined to say “the most beautiful <em>bird</em>,”
    if we except the Long-tailed Humming-bird.</p>

  <p>I had been assured by intelligent men, very familiar with these birds,
    that the Mountain Witch lays in March, in the angle of the roots of a
    tree, on the ground; that the young leave the nest about a week after
    they are hatched, and are led about by the mother, who scratches for
    them in the manner of a fowl. Some have declared that they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span> been
    eye-witnesses of this; persons who have never heard that this pigeon
    has any systematic affinity to the <i>Gallinaceæ</i>. I made many
    inquiries and found the statement very general, almost universal. A
    female shot in March had an egg in the oviduct, shelled and perfectly
    ready for exclusion; it was of a dull reddish-white, unspotted; and
    measured 1&#188; inch by ⁷⁄₈.</p>

  <p>Of many which were procured for me in May, nearly every one was of the
    male sex; and they were shot from trees; on inquiry into this anomaly,
    I was told that during incubation the male invariably lodges in a
    neighbouring tree; a singular deviation from its ordinary habits.</p>

  <p>There is no appreciable difference between the sexes, except that the
    male has the vent, under tail-coverts, and thighs of a deeper chestnut,
    and empurpled. The red of the quills is also brighter.</p>

  <p>I am convinced that our Partridge dove is the <i>montana</i> of
    Linnæus, and not his <i>Martinica</i>; the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span><i>Martinica</i> of
    Temminck, and not his <i>montana</i>; the <i>Pigeon roux de Cayenne</i>
    of Buffon, and not his <i>P. de la Martinique</i>; and that it is not
    the <i>montana</i> of Audubon;—provided the descriptions and figures of
    these naturalists faithfully represent their originals.</p>

  <p>This bird, the female of which is the least beautiful of all our
    Doves, is generally scattered. It affects a well-wooded country, and
    is found in such woods as are more choked with bushes than such as the
    Whitebelly prefers; though they often dwell together. It is essentially
    a ground-pigeon, walking in couples or singly, seeking for seeds or
    gravel on the earth. It is often seen beneath a pimento picking up the
    fallen berries; the physic-nut also and other oily seeds afford it
    sustenance. Sam once observed a pair of these Doves eating the large
    seed of a mango, that had been crushed. With seeds, I have occasionally
    found small slugs, a species of <i>Vaginulus</i>, common in damp
    places, in its gizzard. Often when riding through the Cotta-wood, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>a
    dense and tangled coppice near Content, I have been startled by the
    loud whirring of one of these birds, and at the same instant its short,
    thick-set form has shot across on rapid wing, conspicuous for a moment
    from its bright rufous plumage, but instantly lost in the surrounding
    bushes. When on the ground it is wary and difficult of approach; but
    if it takes a tree, it seems less fearful, and will allow the aim of
    the sportsman. It is in the dry season, and particularly during the
    parching norths that prevail at intervals from November to March, that
    the Partridge, as well as one or two other species of Dove, is numerous
    in the lowland woods. In the summer it is much less frequently seen and
    then only in the deep woods.</p>

  <p>In some districts it is very abundant, though Dr. Chamberlaine
    intimates that it has become scarce in the neighbourhood of Kingston.
    He mentions, as localities in which it may still be found, “the
    pastures beneath the Ferry-hills, and other cool and retired retreats
    in the parishes of St. Catherine’s, St. John’s, St. Ann’s, &amp;c.” To
    these I can add from my own observation, that it is common about Auld
    Ayr and Shrewsbury woods, and abundant at Content, the Cotta-wood, and
    Vinegar Hill, in St. Elizabeth’s and Westmoreland. In the last named
    locality, a lad caught twenty or more, in springes, during two or three
    days, in February. It is readily kept in a cage with other Doves, and
    fed with maize.</p>

  <p>In the Short Cut of Paradise, where the sweet-wood abounds, the
    Partridge is also numerous; in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span> March and April when these berries are
    ripe, their stomachs are filled with them. Here at the same season,
    their cooing resounds, which is simply a very sad moan, usually uttered
    on the ground; but on one occasion we heard it from the limb of a
    cotton tree at Cave, on which the bird sitting, with its head drawn in,
    was shot in the very act. But at a little distance, the voice is not
    distinguishable from the moan of the Mountain Witch.</p>

  <p>A notion prevails that the dark coloured bird is the male, and the
    rufous one the female; but I have proved the contrary, by repeated
    dissections.</p>

  <p>One day in June, I went down with a young friend into a wooded valley
    at Content, to look at a Partridge’s nest. As we crept cautiously
    towards the spot, the male bird flew from it. I was surprised at its
    rudeness; it was nothing but half-a-dozen decayed leaves laid one on
    another, and on two or three dry twigs, but from the sitting of the
    birds it had acquired a slight hollowness, about as much as that of a
    skimmer. It was placed on the top, (slightly sunk among the leaves) of
    a small bush, not more than three feet high, whose glossy foliage and
    small white blossoms reminded me of a myrtle. There were two young,
    recently hatched; callow and peculiarly helpless, their eyes closed,
    their bills large and misshapen,—they bore little resemblance to birds.</p>

  <p>On another occasion, I saw the male shot while sitting; the nest was
    then placed on a slender bush, about five feet from the ground. There
    were but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span> two eggs, of a very pale buff colour; sometimes, however,
    they are considerably darker.</p>

  <p>When seen alive, or recently killed, the affinity of the Partridge-dove
    to the Mountain Witch is very apparent; the stout form, the colour of
    the feet, of the beak, and of the eyelids, and particularly the conical
    form of the head, and a tendency to the projecting hood-like plumage of
    the occiput, help to indicate its true place. It has little resemblance
    to either a <i>Zenaida</i> or a <i>Peristera</i>. The flesh is very
    white; like that of its congener.</p>

  <hr class="tb">

  <p>The woodsmen speak of a Blue Partridge, and a Red-necked Dove; the
    former is figured by Robinson, and is no doubt a ground pigeon. The
    Spanish Partridge (<i id="Starnaenas_cyanocephala">Starnænas cyanocephala</i>) is not considered
    as indigenous in Jamaica, though it is frequently imported thither
    from Cuba. It may, however, yet be found in the precipitous woods of
    the north side; Albin, Brisson, Buffon, and Temminck, attribute it
    positively to our island.</p>

  <p>In a country whose genial climate so closely resembled its own,
    and which abounded with dense and tangled thickets, the well-known
    wandering propensities of the Guinea-fowl would no doubt cause it
    to become wild very soon after its introduction. It was abundant in
    Jamaica as a wild bird, 150 years ago, for Falconer mentions it among
    the wild game, in his amusing “Adventures.” I shall confine myself to a
    few notes of its present habits, which are in all probability those of
    its original condition.</p>

  <p>The Guinea-fowl makes itself too familiar to the settlers by its
    depredations in the provision-grounds. In the cooler months of the
    year, they come in numerous coveys from the woods, and scattering
    themselves in the grounds at early dawn, scratch up the yams and
    cocoes. A large hole is dug by their vigorous feet in very short time,
    and the tubers exposed, which are then pecked away, so as to be almost
    destroyed, and quite spoiled. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>A little later, when the planting season
    begins, they do still greater damage, by digging up and devouring
    the seed-yams, and cocoe-heads, thus frustrating the hopes of the
    husbandman in the bud. “The corn is no sooner put into the ground than
    it is scratched out; and the peas are not only dug up by them, but
    shelled in the pod.” (Dr. Cham.) The sweet potato, however, <em>as I am
    informed</em>, escapes their ravages, being invariably rejected by them.
    To protect the growing provisions, some of the negro peasants have
    recourse to scarecrows, and others endeavour to capture the birds by a
    common rat-gin set in their way. It must, however, be quite concealed,
    or it may as well be at home; it is therefore sunk in the ground, and
    lightly covered with earth and leaves. A springe is useless, unless the
    cord be blackened and discoloured so as to resemble the dry trailing
    stem of some creeper, for they are birds of extreme caution and
    suspicion. It is hence extremely difficult to shoot them, their fears
    being readily alarmed, and their fleetness soon carrying them beyond
    the reach of pursuit. But the aid of a dog, even a common cur, greatly
    diminishes the difficulty. Pursuit by an animal whose speed exceeds
    their own, seems to paralyze them; they instantly betake themselves
    to a tree, whence they may be shot down with facility, as their whole
    senses appear to be concentrated upon one object, the barking cur
    beneath, regarding whom with attent eyes, and outstretched neck, they
    dare not quit their position of defence. Flight cannot be protracted by
    them, nor is it trusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span> to as a means of escape, save to the extent of
    gaining the elevation of a tree: the body is too heavy, the wings too
    short and hollow, and the sternal apparatus too weak, for flight to be
    any other than a painful and laborious performance.</p>

  <p>The Guinea-fowl is sometimes caught by the following stratagem; a small
    quantity of corn is steeped for a night in proof rum, and is then
    placed in a shallow vessel, with a little fresh rum, and the water
    expressed from a bitter cassava, grated; this is deposited within an
    inclosed ground, to which the depredators resort. A small quantity of
    the grated cassava is then strewn over it, and it is left. The fowls
    eat the medicated food eagerly, and are soon found reeling about
    intoxicated, unable to escape, and content with thrusting the head into
    a corner. Frequently a large part of the flock are found dead, from
    this cause.</p>

  <p>Though savoury, and in high request for the table, the Guinea-fowl
    sometimes acquires an insufferably rank odour, from feeding on the
    fetid <i>Petiveria alliacea</i>; and is then uneatable.</p>

  <p>The eggs are deposited in the midst of a dense tussock of grass, to the
    amount of a dozen or more. It is said that occasionally the number is
    greatly higher; and that they are laid <em>stratum super stratum</em>,
    with leaves between. If this is true, probably more than one hen
    participates in the maternity. The wild bird’s egg measures 1⁷⁄₁₀ by
    1⁴⁄₁₀ inch; and weighs 6 dr., 1 sc., 2 gr.—(Rob. MSS.)</p>

  <p>This beautiful game-bird, a native of North America, was introduced
    into Jamaica about a hundred years ago, where it was very soon
    naturalized, and became abundant. It is found in almost all situations,
    where there is cover; and from its peculiar manners, its loud call, and
    the sapidity of its flesh, is familiar to all.</p>

  <p>It is scarcely seen but in coveys of a dozen or more, which run among
    the grass, and, if alarmed, lie so close, as to be unseen till a
    person is at the spot; when suddenly they rise from beneath his feet,
    and fly on rapid wing, and with loud whirr, to a short distance;
    then descending, run so swiftly as to defy pursuit. If, however, on
    springing a covey of Quail, we remain perfectly still, and keep a
    watchful eye on the spot whence they arose, we may chance to see one or
    two still squatting among the grass; for often some remain after their
    companions have departed.</p>

  <p>Various kinds of pulse, and graminaceous seeds <span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>afford it food; in
    winter it lives largely on the small spotted peas of the lesser
    fee-fee, (<i>Clitoria Virginiana</i>.)</p>

  <p>Robinson describes the egg:—“the colour, white; length 1&#188;, breadth
    ¹⁵⁄₁₆ inch. Nineteen were found in one nest.”—(MSS. iii. 159.) He
    afterwards says, “A nest has been known to contain no less than thirty.”</p>

  <hr class="tb">

  <p>Before I dismiss the Gallinaceous birds, I may mention an interesting
    fact, of which Mr. Hill informed me; that the Turkey is, as far as
    European knowledge is concerned, indigenous to the greater Antilles,
    having been found by the Spanish discoverers, already domesticated by
    the Indians; and that the European domestic breed is descended from
    West Indian, and not from North American parentage. This would perhaps
    tend to confirm, what has been suspected, that the domestic Turkey is
    specifically distinct from the wild Turkey of North America.</p>

  <p>I have nothing to add to Wilson’s memoir of this little bird. About
    the beginning of November, they arrive in Jamaica from the north;
    after which they may be seen running swiftly on the mud of morasses,
    and on the sea-beach, in company with Sand-pipers. They feed on small

  <p>It is in the large open pastures of the lowlands that the Tell-tale
    dwells. The traveller, as he passes along, is startled by the sudden
    rise of a dozen or <span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>twenty of these birds, almost from under his feet,
    before unseen, but now manifesting their presence by the shrillest
    cries, as they wheel swiftly round in a large circle, alighting near
    the spot whence they arose. In winter great numbers flock to the
    stony plains, which flying in a dense body afford a fair mark to the
    sportsman, by whom their flesh is esteemed. The majority of these birds
    seem to be merely winter visitants, but a few certainly do remain with
    us through the summer. Robinson says, they lay their eggs among the
    stones near the rivulets.</p>

  <p>One which was shot and wounded in the wing I introduced to the doves,
    in a large packing-case, the front of which was removed, and replaced
    by gauze. Immediately on being put in, it began vigorously charging
    at the gauze, as if it had no idea of any impediment there, running
    backward a little way, and then dashing at it; and this without an
    instant’s intermission, now and then leaping up, and uttering its wild
    cry. For a few minutes its impetuous motions seemed to stupify all the
    doves, who gazed in astonishment; but presently a young Bald-pate, who
    occupied one of the front corners, a very cross and surly fellow, began
    to peck and beat the little Plover, driving him about the cage without
    mercy. I had been struck at the first entry of the bird with its
    remarkable height, owing to the length of the tarsi, and the upright,
    bold attitude in which it stood. At length to escape the persecutions
    of the Bald-pate, it suddenly squatted down in one of the back corners,
    bringing the tarsi flat on the ground, and the tibiæ on them, so that
    I was now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span> struck with its flatness and closeness to the ground; and
    I saw how it is that we so often hear their cry very near, when we
    can see no trace of them, and often suddenly lose sight of them when
    watching them running. I feel assured that this squatting is the bird’s
    natural resource for concealment; for on being alarmed suddenly, its
    first impulse is to bend partially the heel, bringing the body nearer
    the ground; if the danger appear to increase, it brings the tarsi flat,
    the tibiæ still being inclined; the body seems now in contact with the
    ground; but a greater terror brings it still lower, so that it really
    appears as if half sunk in the earth; and now no advance of the danger
    affects it, if there be no opening to run; it lies quite passive; its
    resource is exhausted.</p>

  <p>My captive lay thus unmoved for a while, though the restless Pea-doves,
    in running from side to side, walked over it, trampling it under foot
    at every turn. When it did get up, however, and came to the front, it
    was again instantly assaulted by the Bald-pate, who struck it with his
    wing, and seized its beak with his own, and pinched it. Pitying it
    under these inflictions, I took it out, and allowed it to run about
    the room. Its actions now became quite entertaining; it ran backward
    and forward with surprising fleetness, but, not being used to the
    smoothness of board, though the floor was not at all polished, and
    wanting the support of the back-toe, its speed was continually causing
    it to slip, the feet sliding forward, so as to bring the bird down upon
    its tail. Now and then it would stop, and make repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span> efforts to
    jump over the skirting-board, which being black, and the wall white,
    I suppose it mistook the latter for empty space. While doing this, it
    ever and anon emitted its loud pipe with startling shrillness. Having
    run into a corner, it allowed me to take it up in my hand without
    fluttering. When it stood, it jerked its head up and down. It was
    exceedingly active, when not lying close for concealment; it was not
    still a moment; besides the flirting of the head and tail, a tremulous
    motion pervaded the body, so that it seemed to be shivering. When about
    to take a single step, this was manifested in an odd manner; the foot
    touching the ground three or four times before it was put down. When
    it had become more at home, it devoured earthworms greedily, and would
    pick minute shells and <i>entomostraca</i> from a saucer of water, in
    which was a root of water-cress. In the cage it delighted to stand
    in its water-saucer, but when loose, the saucer being placed in one
    corner, it would run rapidly in and out, now and then stopping to pick
    at the contents.</p>

  <p>It was on the 1st of August, the anniversary of freedom to the slave,
    that I first met with this beautiful bird. By a singular coincidence,
    Sam had been just describing it to me, as a bird not yet obtained,
    when, scarcely five minutes after, on going into the yard, he instantly
    came running in, saying, “Here is a Gaulin, Sir!” I snatched up my
    gun and ran out, and saw the snow-white bird sitting on a castor-oil
    tree, just over the brook. I crept softly towards it, but there being
    no concealment, it took alarm, and flew before I could approach, and I
    lost it among the woods. I determined, however, to seek it, and bade
    my lad follow me. We had noted the direction which it had taken, and
    pursued it towards a bend of the river. Before we had gone a hundred
    yards through the bush, Sam sung out; and there was the bird wheeling
    round in the air close to us, and in a moment it alighted on the
    topmost twig of a low tree. I fired, nervous with expectation, and the
    next instant the lovely bird was at my feet, with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>unruffled plumage,
    and but a single drop of blood oozing through the neck.</p>

  <p>Some weeks after I saw another directing its flagging flight over the
    pasture; it rose gradually as it proceeded, till, when over the river,
    it began to wheel in large circles at a considerable height. After
    perhaps half-a-dozen gyrations, it flew off in nearly a straight line
    for a quarter of a mile or more; then circled in like manner; and again
    pursued the same course until I lost it from sight.</p>

  <p>The Gaulins, or Egrets, are usually shy and vigilant birds, but not
    invariably. One day in May, as I was riding past Cave, my attention was
    called to one of this species, which was fishing in the shallows off
    the rivulet’s mouth, whither it had resorted for several days past.
    Its tameness was remarkable; for negro women were washing within a few
    yards, and it permitted me to ride towards it, and to approach almost
    close, without being alarmed, merely walking slowly away; till at
    last, when I was within three or four yards, it slowly rose to flight,
    but alighted not half a stone’s cast distant. I was pleased to watch
    it a while, observing the spotless whiteness of its plumage, and the
    gracefulness of its form and motions, as it arched its beautiful neck
    with the elegance of a swan.</p>

  <p>In some situations this is not a scarce bird. Passing along by railway
    from Kingston to Spanish Town, I have observed in June, the white forms
    of many Gaulins studding the verdant meadows called the Ferry marshes,
    taking their morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span> meal in the shallows, and by the borders of Fresh
    River. Six or eight were within the space of a hundred yards, all
    feeding, yet not associating.</p>

  <p>On a moringa-tree near the house at Robin’s River, the young friend,
    to whom I am indebted for several notes, used to see the nest of a
    White Gaulin, consisting of sticks and twigs, and about as large as
    a washing-basin; but being in an enclosure, he could not examine it.
    He used often, in passing, to see the bird sitting in it, and looking
    fearlessly at the passengers; for it is close to the high-road. He
    described its beautiful appearance, as it sat in its unspotted purity,
    with its long neck gracefully bent into sigmoid curves, as it gazed
    hither and thither.</p>

  <p>This bird is closely allied to the following species, from which it is
    distinguished by the colour of the beak, lores, and feet, and by the
    ashy tips of the quills.</p>

  <p>The slender contour of this bird, its arching purple neck, its
    filamentous crown-plumes, and the long pointed scapulars arching down
    over its back, combine with its graceful motions and delicate hue, to
    give this bird an aspect of peculiar elegance. Less suspicious than
    most of its tribe, it will frequently allow the beholder to stand and
    admire it, without alarm, as it stands in some shallow stream, or
    secluded pool, intent on its occupation, while the glassy surface gives
    back its beautiful form, unbroken. Its motions are deliberate and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>slow
    while watching for prey; yet its seizure of prey is sudden, and as
    quick as the lightning-flash. It feeds principally on small crabs and
    prawns; which I have always found changed in appearance, by the process
    of digestion; the shell reddened and the flesh coagulated, as if by
    boiling. In one I have found a number of minute eel-like fishes, about
    an inch and a quarter long, probably the fry of a <i>muræna</i>; in
    another, insects. It is usually found excessively fat.</p>

  <p>A specimen, shot from a tree, fell into rather deep water; and though
    one foot was disabled, it struck out vigorously with the other, and
    <em>swam</em> in an upright posture, with the head drawn back (<em>not
    struggling</em>,) several yards, before it was seized.</p>

  <p>It is not common enough for me to determine whether it is migratory or
    not; I have obtained specimens on the 16th of September and on the 9th
    of April, and through the intervening winter.</p>

    <p>Irides cream-white; lores deep fulvous, with an oblong dusky spot near
      the edge of upper mandible; beak, black above, clay-colour beneath;
      feet dull pea-green. Crown, cheeks, and neck pale brick-red, mingled
      with dark grey feathers. Back ashy-grey, with pale reddish tips;
      scapulars and quills blue-grey; coverts grey with red tips, almost
      wholly red towards the edge of the wing. Rump and tail-coverts white.
      Tail dark grey. Chin, throat, and whole under parts yellowish-white,
      but down the front of neck an irregular series of rufous feathers,
      forming dashes on the white; and a few blackish feathers on the breast.</p>
  </div>

  <p>I first met with this undescribed species in a little excursion up the
    beautiful Burnt Savanna <span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>River, on the 25th of November. The immense
    morass through which it flows, looking like a sea of rushes, relieved
    here and there by clumps of the tall and slender palmetto, affords
    shelter and sustenance to immense numbers of aquatic birds, in common
    with Black River, of which this is a main branch. Of this species
    of Gaulin, which is not remarkable for beauty, the only specimen,
    besides, that I met with, was shot by Sam, at Bluefields Creek, on the
    7th of May. Both individuals had been feeding on a small species of
    <i>Gobius</i>, called mud-fish.</p>

  <p>Though birds which feed exclusively on animal matters are ordinarily
    marked by the shortness of the intestinal canal, the tribe before us
    forms a remarkable exception to this rule; while the body of this bird
    was less than four inches in length, the intestine measured seventy-two
    inches. The neck is more than usually long in this species.</p>

  <p>It is doubtless a permanent resident in the Island.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This richly-coloured species is found wherever there is running water;
    and most abundantly, where in the plains the sluggish streams expand
    into broad reedy pools, or spongy marshes. Though perfectly solitary in
    its habits, one may frequently see in such situations a dozen within a
    quarter of a mile; and as we walk on, another and another long neck is
    suddenly reared above the grass, to gaze at the intruder and estimate
    the danger. Usually they are too wary to allow of a near approach; but
    this varies according to the locality; for while, in lonely places, as
    Paradise marshes, one may easily get within shot, in such streams as
    Bluefields and Robin’s River, where persons are continually passing, an
    approach within a long distance instantly puts the watchful bird upon
    the wing. In the former case it alights again immediately, but in the
    latter it does not stay its flight, until it gains the shelter of the
    woods, or a distant part of the stream. But in the morning, as soon as
    its appetite has been <span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>sated, its stomach gorged with prey, it often
    rests on some dry tree in the vicinity, whence it is less willing to
    fly, and may often be approached and shot with ease.</p>

  <p>Near where the Sweet River roars and boils beneath the bridge, on the
    road from Bluefields to Savanna le Mar, there runs along by the side of
    the road, a narrow stream with grassy banks. As I was riding by, one
    day in July, I observed one of these Bitterns on the bank. It was not
    sufficiently alarmed to take flight as I passed, and I therefore drew
    up under the shade of a cocoa-nut palm on the other side to watch it.
    A few minutes it remained in suspicious stillness, eyeing me askant.
    At length with much deliberation it walked towards the edge, where it
    stood, intently watching the grass and short reeds that fringed the
    side. Presently it picked something from a stalk of grass, which it
    swallowed; it then waded slowly into the stream till the water reached
    above the tarsus, and there stood gazing motionless, except that now
    and then it suddenly altered the direction of its glance. A quick
    stroke of its powerful beak brought up something of considerable size,
    with which it walked ashore; it dropped its prey on the grass, and
    began to pick from it. Wishing to know what it was, I drove the bird
    away, but it was cunning enough to pick up its booty and carry it off,
    so that I was none the wiser. It was probably a root of some aquatic
    plant. The Bittern, however, soon returned, and taking its former
    place, resumed the occupation of picking insects from the grass, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
    grew in the stream. As it walked hither and thither, the beautiful
    chestnut neck was alternately thrown forward and bridled up, with a
    pretty affectation, and the short tail was depressed and agitated with
    a rapid perpendicular vibration. I would have observed it longer, but a
    rude group of negroes passing, it flew away over the adjacent logwood
    bushes.</p>

  <p>The flight of all the Herons is flagging and laborious: I have been
    amused to see a Humming-bird chasing a Heron; the minuteness and arrowy
    swiftness of the one contrasting strangely with the expanse of wing and
    unwieldy motion of the other. The little aggressor appears to restrain
    his powers in order to annoy his adversary, dodging around him and
    pecking at him like one of the small frigates of Drake or Frobisher
    peppering one of the unwieldy galleons of the ill-fated Armada. Now and
    then, however, I have noticed this and other species of Heron intermit
    this laborious motion, and sail swiftly and gracefully on balanced
    wings, particularly when inclining their flight towards the earth.</p>

  <p>When wounded, so as to be unable to fly, the Green Bittern seeks
    to escape by running, which it does swiftly, the neck projected
    horizontally, uttering a low cluck at intervals. Its ordinary call,
    often uttered from the morasses and mangrove swamps, is a loud scream,
    harsh and guttural.</p>

  <p>In each specimen that I dissected, the stomach was enormous, occupying
    the whole length and breadth of the body; it usually is found distended
    with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span> larvæ of <i>libelluladæ</i> and <i>dyticidæ</i>, and with
    freshwater prawns. The latter lie in the stomach always in the same
    way; viz. doubled up, the head and tail pointing forwards, the only way
    in which they could be swallowed with safety.</p>

  <p>In all the <i>Ardeadæ</i> that I have examined, there are on the breast
    two masses of filamentous down, commonly of a pale buff hue, lying just
    over the furcula; beneath which, attached to the inner surface of the
    skin, are two flat glandular bodies of singular appearance. A similar
    tuft and structure are found just above the tail. With their object I
    am quite unacquainted.</p>

    the tall reeds that clothe the morasses, or among the rank sedgy grass
    that borders the streams. If alarmed it does not usually fly, but darts
    into the rushy cover, where the thinness of its form enables it to
    make its way <span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>with ease. Frequently it crouches, as if hoping to lie
    unobserved.</p>

  <p>The stomachs of several that I have dissected contained small fishes
    and Crustacea.</p>

  <p>Though a common inhabitant of the deep and fetid morasses, where the
    sombre mangrove crosses its tangled roots in inextricable confusion,
    this fine bird is much oftener heard than seen. The superstitious
    negro, whose heart is in his throat if he is compelled to stir beyond
    his threshold by night, is often startled by the loud and hoarse
    <em>quok</em> of this bird, suddenly emitted from the dark solitudes on
    either side of the road, or from the branches of a tree above his head,
    where the bird is roosting for the night. Occasionally, when out before
    day, seeking some birds which are to be shot only at dawn, I have
    myself heard the same loud cry <span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>repeated with deliberation, while the
    sudden flapping of large wings told that the bird, not less startled,
    was seeking a station less liable to interruption, farther within the
    morass. In floating down such broad streams as Burnt Savanna, or Black
    River, where they are margined by tall overhanging mangrove-woods,
    we often see this bird, seated on some high branch, which commands a
    wide prospect; but no sooner is the canoe espied, than he spreads his
    immense wings, and sails heavily off with the customary vociferation.
    Vigilant and suspicious, it is not an easy thing to shoot the Quok,
    unless the sportsman see it first, and conceal himself before he is
    discovered, or cautiously creep towards the secluded retreat where he
    hears the voice. But this is almost a forlorn hope; for the senses of
    the bird are very acute, and he takes alarm from the slight sounds made
    by the most circumspect footsteps, and escapes in time. Any unusual
    noise will provoke the utterance of the unmusical voice; a shout, or
    the report of a distant gun, will be answered from several parts of the
    morass; and not only by this species, but in various tones by other
    Herons and Bitterns.</p>

  <p>It is a noble bird; its commanding height, erect attitude, stout
    built frame, fiery eye, powerful beak, hanging crest, and handsome
    plumage, give it an imposing aspect. Crabs and other Crustacea
    form its principal diet; evidently swallowed entire, though often
    of considerable size. The flesh is dark; the fat, which is usually
    abundant, is of a deep yellow tinge. Notwithstanding the powerful voice
    of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span> bird, the trachea is weak, and destitute of convolution or
    enlargement, save at the divarication of the bronchi.</p>

  <p>A specimen was shot in April, in the spotted plumage, which is supposed
    to indicate youth. It fell into the water, wounded, where it began
    to swim, the head erect, and the body no more immersed than that of
    a duck; it struck out with both feet, and made rapid way towards the
    roots of a mangrove near, on reaching which it jumped out of water, and
    ran up, but was then secured. In this state it is sometimes called the
    Guinea-hen Quok, from the white spots on the grey ground; and I am not
    sure that it is not distinct. One that was shot in May in this plumage,
    a female, had eggs in the ovary as large as pepper-corns.</p>

  <hr class="tb">

  <p>Mr. Hill mentions to me as indigenous <i>Ardeadæ</i>, besides such
    as have come into my hands,—the Great Heron (<i>Ardea Herodias</i>),
    the Great White Heron (<i>Egretta leuce?</i>), the American Bittern
    (<i>Botaurus minor</i>), and the Roseate Spoon-bill (<i>Platalea
    ajaja</i>).</p>

  <p>The first of these was not an unfamiliar visitant in the vicinity of
    Bluefields, being often seen by myself and others at early dawn on the
    sea-shore, and at the edges of the mangrove swamps. Once or twice we
    have known a particular tree on which the bird roosted, and Sam has
    repeatedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span> watched both before break of day and after dusk, but could
    never succeed in obtaining a shot at the bird, so excessive was its
    vigilance.</p>

  <p>The second I once saw at a great distance while on the Burnt Savanna
    River in November, its long white neck towering above the thick reeds;
    I judged it to be between four and five feet high. At length it flew to
    a distant tree; the morass precluding the possibility of my gratifying
    my desire to possess it.</p>

  <p>This is, I presume, the species alluded to by Mr. Hill in the former
    part of the following note.—“I must not omit to mention that in Cuba
    I saw very usually, in the small farms by the sea-side, the large
    White Egret or <i>Garzota</i> in a state of mansuetude. The Flamingo
    was not unfrequently its companion in this unrestrained captivity, if
    we may use this contradictory expression to represent a state where
    reconcilement to servitude included a full permission to the birds to
    use their wings in flight. The abundant food obtained from the refuse
    of the fishermen’s nets on the beach at day-break, supplied them with
    an early and full meal for the day, and explained the mystery of this
    willing captivity. In St. Domingo I visited a woodland farm, situated
    by the side of some fine freshwater ponds, the resort of numerous wild
    ducks in the season, where the submission to life among the poultry,
    on the part of one of the <em>small Egrets</em>, was the result of
    association only. What was most remarkable was the determination of
    this bird always to occupy the centre of the roost, by the side of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span> the
    patriarchal cock. I stayed purposely till roosting time, to see him
    shift his place after gaining the roost-tree, until he got his station
    in the middle of the dormitory.”</p>

  <hr class="tb">

  <p>In some seasons the Scarlet Ibis (<i>Ibis rubra</i>) is not an
    uncommon visitant on the shores of Jamaica; but I have not met with
    it. The present winter, 1846-7, Mr. Hill informs me, has brought it
    in somewhat numerously. On the same authority, I mention two species
    of Curlews, the one known as the Black Curlew, which is <i>Numenius
    longirostris</i>, the other called the White Curlew, which may be <i>N.
    Hudsonicus</i>, or perhaps <i>Ibis alba</i>.</p>

    swiftly over the boggy and wet soil, as the other Sandpipers do.</p>

  <p>Out of the same flock I found some, both males and females, which
    had the beak considerably broader and flatter than others; some also
    have the feet blackish, and others clay-colour. In other respects the

    north about the end of August, and remains certainly till after the
    middle of April, and I am not sure that individuals do not stay all the
    summer.</p>

  <p>Wilson has delineated the manners of this bird in a very interesting
    manner, to which I have nothing to add. One which was wounded in the
    wing, I put into a cage for an hour or two; during <span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>which time it
    frequently made a succession of charges at the wires, squatting down at
    intervals on the belly. When it walked, it was in a singular manner;
    the heel much bent, the tarsus forming an acute angle with the ground,
    and the toes thrown forward.</p>

  <p>About the ponds of pastures, and fresh-water morasses, this Sandpiper
    or Gambet is frequently seen; and that not quite so solitarily as
    Wilson found it. The gizzard of one that I dissected was filled with a
    blackish, unctuous, filamentous substance, among which I detected some
    fragments of minute water-insects, a small larva of a <i>libellula</i>,
    &amp;c.</p>

  <p>One day, as I was seeking Herons in Paradise marshes, I aimed at a bird
    twice in succession, but each time the cap detonated without igniting
    the charge: the slight sound alarmed two or three Bar-tails, that were
    close by, and caused them to rise a few yards into the air, where they
    remained several seconds, hovering, the wings held perpendicularly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
    and nearly meeting over the back, after which they settled down again.
    One, whose wing had been broken, I allowed to run about my room, having
    first cut off the dangling joint. It had much of the manners of the
    Kildeer (see p. 331), but frequently held up the wings perpendicularly,
    when running.</p>

  <p>That the power of swimming does not depend on webbed feet, is now
    pretty well known; some instances I have mentioned already. A
    Bar-tail, shot at Mount Edgecumbe pond, plunged into the water, and
    swam vigorously, striking out with both feet. On another occasion a
    Sandpiper, I do not know of what species, being wounded, plunged into
    a river, and swam some distance; but Sam pursuing and approaching it,
    it dived, and swam swiftly under water, like a Grebe, coming up at the
    distance of several yards, then instantly diving again, till at last it
    effected its escape among the reeds and bushes at the margin.</p>

    always solitary, wading in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>the shallows of Crab-pond, and picking. The
    stomachs of those I obtained, contained a mass of pulverulent matter,
    which, on being separated in water, seemed to consist largely, if not
    wholly, of insects. Some soft larvæ, apparently dipterous, and parts
    of rather large yellow ants, I recognised in one, and in another the

    informed me, that both this and the preceding species were particularly
    abundant; the numbers of these birds procured by the market sportsmen
    of Spanish-town and Kingston, being quite extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The specimen I obtained does not exactly agree with the descriptions
    I have read, the breast and sides being marked with zigzags of black,
    which are large and conspicuous on the flanks. The gizzard, which was
    muscular, contained a greenish unctuous mass, which showed traces of
    scales, or else the plated covering of <i>crustacea</i>.</p>

  <p>From November to April this beautiful and delicious bird is rather
    common in the morasses of Jamaica. In the fetid swamp that borders
    Bluefields Creek, I have principally met with it, running on the boggy
    places, some of which are dangerous and difficult of approach. When the
    tide comes in, however, the wading birds are driven to the edges of the
    morass, and may then be seen from the high road at Belmont, walking and
    feeding deliberately in the shallow water, among the slender stems of
    the black mangroves, not half a stone’s cast from the passers by. When
    the water stands just above the tarsal joint, the beak can just reach
    the bottom: and thus it walks deliberately about, momentarily feeling
    the mud with the sensitive beak-tip, striking with short perpendicular
    strokes. Now and then we perceive the motion of swallowing. So absorbed
    is the bird in its occupation, that I have shouted aloud, without its
    taking any notice; nor when its eye at last caught the motion of my
    hand, did it more than run, somewhat leisurely, away.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span></p>

  <p>The present season (1846-7,) seems to be more than usually favourable
    to the influx of the migrant <i>Grallæ</i> from the north. Mr. Hill
    mentions, in a recent letter, that a friend, R. Wilkie, Esq., bagged
    twenty-two brace of Snipe in one day’s shooting, in October.</p>

  <hr class="tb">

  <p>Other <i>Scolopacidæ</i> that have been observed in Jamaica are
    the Knit (<i>Tringa Canutus</i>), the Sanderling (<i>Calidris
    Arenaria</i>), the Willet (<i>Catoptrophorus semipalmatus</i>), and the
    Little Woodcock (<i>Rusticola minor</i>). These I have not seen, but
    the first three, Mr. Hill writes me, are plentiful there, this winter.
    A second species of Woodcock, also, has been reported to have been met
    with in the island.</p>

  <p>This curious bird, which, from its anomalous formation, has been
    a subject of considerable interest to ornithologists, seems to be
    much better known by its form and plumage, than by its habits. I am

  <p>The Clucking-hen derives its provincial name from its ordinary
    voice, when ranging its mountain solitudes. One day in August, I was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>collecting mosses on the Bluefields Peak, where it is densely covered
    with tall but slender wood, when Sam called my attention to this bird,
    which we heard walking at a little distance, around us, crackling the
    dried sticks and stones, and clucking deliberately with a voice exactly
    resembling that of a sauntering fowl. I sent the lad round to drive
    it gently towards me, while I remained still; and presently I saw it
    walking swiftly to and fro, but a few yards distant. While Sam was
    pursuing it it rose to wing, and alighted again immediately; but soon
    ran into the recesses of the woods beyond reach.
  </p>

  <p>The negroes often assured me that a precipitous gully, that cleaves the
    mountain behind Bluefields, thickly clothed with large timber, abounded
    with these birds, but it was not until February that I obtained a
    specimen. At that time the parching drought having wasted the mountain
    pools, I was told that Clucking-hens might be met with in numbers, at
    the edge of the woods around the spot where the spring of Bluefields
    River gushes out of the mountain’s foot. It was said that many <span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>were in
    the habit of selecting high trees in that vicinity as roosting-places.
    My servants having on several evenings heard the loud cries of these
    birds proceeding from the spot, I sent them thither one evening to
    watch. As night drew on, the birds were seen and heard around, and
    though they could not obtain a shot, they succeeded in getting a more
    definite knowledge of the individual trees selected.</p>

  <p>An evening or two afterwards, I myself went to the spot with them:
    before sunset the loud cry of one was heard, apparently descending
    the mountain, but it was not until the grey twilight was fading into
    darkness that we began to hear them screaming and flying around. The
    notes were singular; sometimes a series of shrill screams were uttered
    in succession, then a harsh cry, <em>krau, krau, krau,
    kreaow</em>. All were loud, sudden, and startling. More than one
    alighted on a large hog-plum not far off, a tree which they seem to
    affect, but were too wary to allow of my approaching within gun-shot.
    Sam, who was watching a hundred yards distant, was more fortunate, for
    as I was stealthily creeping towards my bird, I heard the report of
    his piece, and had the satisfaction of learning that he had secured
    his game, the first specimen of this interesting bird that I had an
    opportunity of examining.</p>

  <p>The ordinary spring-rains were distressingly deficient in 1846; and
    hence I presume it was, that, through the month of April, several birds
    of this species were in the habit of frequenting the morasses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span> on each
    side of the swiftly-flowing Paradise River. Where the bridle-path
    called the Short Cut crosses the stream, there grow many bushes of
    Black-Withe, about as large as an ordinary apple-tree; many of these
    are clothed with a dense and matted drapery of convolvolus so thick as
    to hide the bush completely. On the very summit of these bushes, the
    Clucking-hens might often be seen at early day, the tangled creepers
    affording a support for their broad feet, where they stood and turned
    without sinking and without embarrassment. They stood boldly erect,
    as if watching, their dark figures relieved against the sky, in an
    attitude exactly like that of an Ibis, though they flirted the tail in
    the manner of a Rail. At brief intervals they uttered a short sharp
    sound, and sometimes the loud harsh scream, <em>krēaow</em>. On being
    alarmed, they flew heavily and slowly, with the long legs hanging down,
    and the neck stretched forward, having a very awkward appearance in the
    air.</p>

  <p>About June, they had again retired to the loftier elevations: at the
    middle of that month, I used to hear their loud cries at an early hour,
    on the mountains of Grand Vale and Hampstead, above Content. There
    was a large pond just within the woods, to which they resorted; for
    the drought still prevailed. My young friend, who had often seen them
    there, informed me that they scratch and pick like a fowl.</p>

  <p>The head and beak of the Clucking-hen bears an obvious resemblance to
    those of the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span> species, <i>Rallus longirostris</i>, except
    that the nasal grooves are nearly obliterated in the <i>Aramus</i>. The
    feet also are similar. The sternum is that of neither <i>Rallus</i> nor
    <i>Ardea</i>, but is closely like that of <i>Psophia</i>.</p>

  <p>A female was brought me on the 1st of April, in the afternoon, which
    had been just shot as it was standing in shallow water at Bluefields
    river-head, fishing. The freshness of the subject enabled me to examine
    it carefully. The stomachic sac consisted of a gizzard separated by a
    narrow constriction from a long proventriculus, about twice as large
    as the gizzard, and of a sub-oval, flattened form. This was divided by
    the structure of the parietes into two very distinct parts, the upper
    portion being much thickened, and studded with small round glands, so
    as to look like shagreen. The lower and larger portion was muscular,
    the inner surface having longitudinal <i>rugæ</i>. The gizzard was
    comparatively smooth within, and thinner than the proventriculus.
    The latter was stuffed with small water-snails (<i>Ampullaria</i>),
    divested of the shells, but not, in all cases, of the opercula, which
    filled even the œsophagus almost to the fauces. In the upper part of
    the proventriculus, the snails were little changed; in the lower they
    were macerated and more slimy, but in the gizzard there was nothing
    but a hard mass of blackish, almost homogeneous matter, nearly dry by
    the expression of its moisture. The intestinal canal measured fifty
    inches; (in another specimen forty-two inches;) about an inch from the
    cloaca, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span> cæca branched off, the left longer by half an inch than
    the right. I could find no gall-bladder. The body, when divested of the
    integuments is compressed, but not so decidedly as in either Herons or
    Rails.</p>

  <p>In the male bird the trachea at the distance of about two inches above
    the furcula, takes an immense convolution, forming a complicated knot;
    the form of the turnings is not always the same, nor is their extent;
    I have seen one much more complicated than in the specimen dissected
    by Mr. Eyton,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and some less so. The volutions are connected by
    a mesentery. At the point where the bronchi divaricate, the trachea
    dilates into a large oval box. In the female the trachea is quite
    simple, having no trace of the convolution, nor of the bronchial box.
    I hence infer that the loud startling cries are uttered only by the
    male. As in the Rails, the abdominal viscera are very large; the cæca
    in particular, when distended, are enormous.</p>

  <p>Robinson states that the Aramus feeds upon snakes, toads, and
    lizards, as well as wood-snails, and gully-crabs, yet not on his own
    observation, but on the authority of “people of credit, who have seen
    junks of undigested snakes and lizards taken out of their craws.”
    This is not confirmed, however, by my own observation, gasteropod
    mollusca having been found in every specimen I have examined. Mr.
    Hill’s observation does not confirm the former statement. Of one which
    was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>sent to him in July 1842, he remarks, “Having opened the craw
    for the purpose of ascertaining the food it had been eating, I found
    nothing but a quantity of a dark pulverulent substance, very much
    resembling decayed wood; a substance which a bird with such a bill as
    the Clucking-hen has, might be supposed to pick up with the worms it
    might find in the decaying wood. There was no trace of any animal body,
    neither wings of beetles, nor vertebræ of lizards.” It may be added
    that this specimen when discovered, “flew from where a limb of rotten
    log-wood had been broken off; perhaps it was eating some of the large
    wood-worms.”</p>

  <p>Mr. Eyton’s bird was sent from Honduras: if it had been a Jamaican
    specimen, I should have guessed that the zoophyte which seemed to
    resemble a sea-anemone, was a large species of <i>Vaginulus</i> common
    in the mountains.</p>

  <p>From the general, though not total, absence of the shells of the snails
    which I have found, I judge that the shell is crushed with the beak,
    and shaken off before the snail is swallowed. The opercula, which are
    frequently found attached, have enabled me to recognise the genera
    <i>Ampullaria</i>, <i>Cyclostoma</i>, and <i>Helicina</i>; the latter
    two, terrestrial snails.</p>

  <p>The piercing cries with which the Clucking-hen salutes the approach
    of night, are little heard at any other time: during the day it more
    commonly emits the deliberate clucking above mentioned, as it saunters
    hither and thither in the mountain-woods, or among the cocoes of the
    provision-grounds.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span> We sometimes hear the harsh sounds proceeding from
    the forest, even after night has established its dominion, and hence,
    probably, it has been considered a nocturnal bird; I suspect, however,
    that these cries are not the accompaniments of activity, but the
    harbingers of repose, emitted while sitting on the roosting tree, or
    while flying to and fro in preparation for alighting; the cries which
    are heard at a rather later hour marking, probably, the awaking from
    the first sleep, as they soon relapse into silence.</p>

  <p>In the woods of the parish of St. David’s these birds are said to
    be abundant, as also in the mountainous districts of St. Ann’s, St.
    Dorothy’s, and the Coona-coonas. Swift of foot, if not of wing, the
    Aramus does not confine itself, however, to one or two localities,
    but ranges, with rapid sidelong strides, the lonely woods from the
    mountain-tops to the mangrove morasses of the shore. Solitary and shy,
    it is a difficult bird to approach, but when obtained is esteemed by
    some as “the best wildfowl of the country.” “The flesh of this bird,”
    says Dr. Chamberlaine, “acquires, about the termination of the year,
    that plumpness, which gives it a claim to be placed in the catalogue of
    edible birds. It is then esteemed fit for the table, and may be dressed
    in two ways; viz., in fricassée, or roasted like the Guinea-birds, and
    smothered, after being cut up, in a rich salade.” Mr. Hill observes
    of the specimen which came into his possession; “I directed the whole
    of the muscles on either side of the <em>sternum</em> to be cut out and
    cooked. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span> found its flavour indescribably fine, a compound of hare,
    partridge, and pigeon. The flesh was of peculiarly close and compact
    texture, and as peculiarly tender.” I would add to these, my own
    testimony to its excellence.</p>

  <p>Of its domestic economy, I know nothing, except that Robinson asserts,
    that “it lays nine eggs in December.” In February, I found eggs in
    the ovary of a female, as large as small peas: another, in June, had
    about half-a-dozen a little larger than peas, about a dozen as large as
    pigeon-shot, and many small.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hill, in a letter written since my return to England, informs me,
    that “for the last month of the late drought, [summer of 1846] numbers
    of Clucking Aramuses made their appearance about the river-swamps and
    marshes in the Caymanas district of this parish. They were a bird
    almost unknown in these plains. As slugs and snails were very plentiful
    in these, the only moist places at that time, we perceive what the
    attraction to this locality was, that brought them so numerously
    together, beside the desire for water.”</p>

  <p>The Clucking-hen was among the birds sent from Cuba by Mr. Mac Leay.</p>

  <p>The reader shall be introduced to the bird before us, by the delightful
    pen of my friend, Mr. Hill.</p>

  <p>“14th of March, 1842. I have visited Passage Fort at a season when
    Wild-ducks are stretching from one side of the Bay to the other in
    strings, and Plovers and Sandpipers are feeding in little flocks on
    the beach. The nights and the mornings are quiet, but the day is one
    uninterrupted bluster of the sea-breeze. The country is dry. Many of
    the large trees are leafless, and there is no verdure in the grass.
    Such a picture would seem to afford no great diversity for amusement:
    the sea, however, is always an interesting object. Whether calm or
    stirring it has a variety of features, all different at different hours
    of the day. The repose of morning; the slumbering ocean; the sleepy
    mountains kerchiefed in clouds; the awakened daylight peeping through
    the curtains of night; the birds just risen and moving; the little
    flocks wending about as if the day had its business to attend to; the
    Herons and Egrets shaking their wings by the mirrory waters, and making
    their toilet <span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>there. All this is a pleasant mixture of repose and
    activity; of the stir from sleeping to waking; in which nature is never
    seen to such advantage, as in the magnitude of a view that mingles the
    ocean with the earth.</p>

  <p>“The day is gathering brighter and brighter; but the mountains rise
    between me and the sun, and are one dull blue mass, neither deeply nor
    faintly blue, but clear, and yet obscure. On the beach the fishermen
    are silently hauling their seine, sweeping, with its line of dotted
    corks, such a circuit on the waters, that it seems to take in half
    the bay. At a distance off, the flats loaded with grass are getting
    under weigh. Busy men and women are on the beach launching canoes and
    preparing for the market. The sails are hoisted, and the masses, that
    lay like logs upon the water, just stir, and glide out into the glaring
    bay. Amid all this hushed movement, there is one pervading sound,
    the murmurs of the distant breakers. This voice is seldom silent;
    in the stillest lull there will be heard this roll of the restless
    surge.——There is a sweet melancholy voice that comes from the bordering
    mangroves along the river: it is the morning call of the Pea-dove.
    It is responded to by a faint low cooing from the hill-side woods.
    It is repeated again and again; and again it is replied to far away.
    And now there are other sounds. The Crotophagas are trooping to the
    river-shallows, and calling to each other to settle among the sedges,
    where the receding tide has left them living food. There is a sound
    overhead like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span> hurtling of arrows. It is a flock of Wild-ducks
    flitting from the Salt Island ponds to the Lagoons on the other side
    the bay: and again there is another sound of gathered tribes moving
    through the air. It resembles bubbling waters. It is a flight of
    Tinklings shifting from their rookery to their feeding grounds in the
    morasses. Streams of smoke are curling up from various points of the
    mountains, like the morning sacrifices of hill-worshippers of old.
    A shower has scudded along the loftiest of the ridges and shown the
    deep indentings of the elevated country, by the different depths of
    the misty haze.—It has passed away, and the heights are now lighted
    by the full blaze of the uprisen sun. The clouds cast deep shadows on
    the mountain declivities, and the highest points of the chain pierce
    through the masses, rolling one upon the other, thick and accumulated.</p>

  <p>“The sea-breeze is in. It comes as no other breeze comes, and feels as
    no other breeze feels. At first two or three whiffles make darkened
    tracks on the glassy waters. Then half the sea afar off is covered with
    ripples. The ripples come creeping on, and the wind has reached the
    shore. Two minutes pass, and a line of small breakers are chasing each
    other on the beach. From this time the constant wind never lulls, but
    sweeps with ‘a steady unrelenting force from the bright east.’</p>

  <p>“Noon. In a small stretch of marsh land, through which the river has
    cut two or three channels, and left several smaller meandering dykes
    very clear and open, with pools and little lakes shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span> in from the
    sea by sand-banks, there is a good deal of rank grass (<i>Digitaria
    stolonifera</i>) growing, on which the village goats congregate to
    feed at mid-day, that being the time when the ground is least swampy.
    Among the sedge and bulrushes that cover the flooded parts, at the
    same noon-tide hours, the <em>crek, crek, crek</em>, of
    the Water-rail is heard, with that kind of impatient reiterated sound,
    with which Guinea-fowl call to each other. This call is a summons for
    the birds to quit the sedges, and seek the muddy shoals and half-dry
    ooze, to feed. Two or three birds nearly, if not quite, as large as
    half grown pullets, of a dingy ash-colour, come over a low intervening
    wall where I am, and feed in the open yard. The country people call
    this bird the Mangrove-hen, from its appearance, its habits, and its
    haunts. It greatly resembles the dappled grey variety of the common
    fowl; and in the breeding season it rambles about with its callow
    brood, like a hen and chickens. After one of these visits, I went and
    traced the footmarks in the mud, and found that the Mangrove-hens
    had been searching for small crabs. Worms, shell-fish, insects, and
    crustacea are its animal food, and the seeds and shoots of aquatic
    plants, its vegetable. As the rank-growing herbage is necessary for
    its concealment, and creative wisdom has adapted it, like the rest of
    its tribe, by an extraordinary expansion of the foot, for walking on
    weedy waters, and so compressed its body that it threads with alacrity
    reeds and rushes; the mangrove thickets, which it commonly haunts, are
    those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span> that grow in tide-waters, and at the mouths of rivers, and in
    neighbourhoods luxuriant in aquatic herbage. These are the prevailing
    thickets at Passage Fort: I therefore find every body there familiar
    with the Mangrove-hen. As these birds have much of the character of the
    <i>gallinaceæ</i>, and are able to run and feed themselves as soon as
    they are hatched, they are, when half grown, as helpless on the wing as
    half-fledged poultry. At the pullet age, when feeding out on the mud
    and shoals, they are run down with great facility. At this time they
    are delicious eating. Persons, on whose taste I can depend, tell me,
    that, though a Plover be undoubtedly a fine bird for the table, and
    the Sanderling a great delicacy, the Mangrove-hen exceeds both; as it
    combines all their peculiarity of flavour with the fleshiness of the
    Quail. This is no small commendation.”</p>

  <p>To this interesting note, I have little to add. At Crabpond, where
    rounded clumps of mangroves are scattered like islets in a lake, we
    have observed it frequently running quickly and timidly from one cover
    to another, exposing itself in the open pond as little as possible. As
    it walks under the arched roots, it holds its short tail nearly erect.</p>

  <p>In a specimen dissected in December, I found fragments of crabs; and
    a large one, nearly whole, was in the craw: the stomach is a muscular
    gizzard. This individual was excessively fat.</p>

  <p>One brought to me alive in May, taken in a springe, bit fiercely and
    pertinaciously at anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span> presented to it, shaking it like a dog. It
    uttered in rapid succession the most deafening screams.</p>

  <p>The long beak, and the spurs upon the winglet, distinguish this species
    from our other Rails.</p>

      beak yellowish-green, blackish above; feet dull purplish-crimson, or
      pink. Plumage reddish-brown, dark on back and wings; brighter and
      redder on sides; paler and more ashy on belly. Wing-quills blackish.
  </div>

  <p>The gallinaceous form common to the Rails, and the red hue of this
    species have given to it the provincial name of Water Partridge. It
    affects freshwater morasses, and secluded streams, rather than saline
    swamps, and is found even on the mountain acclivities. I have shot
    it skulking among the aquatic weeds at Basin Spring. As it roams, it
    utters at intervals of a few seconds, a <em>cluck</em>, like a hen. The
    remarkable thinness of body, common to all this tribe, beautifully
    adapts them for making their way through close herbage.</p>

  <p>It is sometimes seen perched on a low tree by the road-side, at which
    time it seems to have lost its usual shyness, and sits looking at the
    sportsman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span> until he nearly comes up to it. Its flight is singularly
    ineffective; slow, heavy, and laboured; the head is projected,
    and the body hangs down, as I have seen the body of some unwieldy
    <i>Bombyx</i>, distended with eggs: the feet also are pendent.</p>

  <p>I have never found in the gizzard of the Red-Rail, (which though small,
    is muscular) anything but a homogeneous cream or mud of a dark brown
    hue; or a green mucus.</p>

  <p>The flesh is pale and flabby; the fat of a rich salmon-red.</p>

  <p>A specimen sent to Mr. Hill by Dr. Hay from the neighbourhood of the
    Black River, in St. Elizabeth’s, illustrated, in the manner of its
    capture, the habits of the genus. The Doctor observed, while standing
    on the steps of the house at Elim Estate, this Rail sauntering through
    the grass. He pursued it, and ran it among some oleanders that grew in
    clumps about, and succeeded in getting it. When brought into the house,
    the bird shot rapidly across the floor, and getting into a darkened
    corner of the room, remained quiet there, believing itself concealed.
    On being driven out from that hiding-place, it again scudded away
    over the floor to another dark corner, in which it remained quiet as
    before. These recesses seemed to represent the dense coverts in which
    it ordinarily conceals itself in apprehended danger; its reliance on
    which, doubtless, made it so easy a prey to its captor’s hand, when it
    had taken refuge among the stems of the oleanders.</p>

  <p>The only specimen of this bird that I possess was shot among the reeds
    in Salt Spring morass, near Black River, the habitation of incredible
    numbers of these and similar birds. It was near the end of November.
    Though it slightly differs from Wilson’s description, in the buff
    hue of the vent being scarcely noticeable, I conclude that it is of
    his species; the rather, since Mr. Hill has procured a specimen from
    Passage Fort, in which the buff hue was conspicuous. His specimen was
    obtained in March. It is probably a winter visitant from the United
    States, where Wilson describes it as an abundant species.</p>

  <p>In the stomach of that which I dissected, I found only mud and coarse
    siliceous sand.</p>

  <p>Le petit Râle de Cayenne of Buffon, (Pl. enl. 817) is probably a female
    of this species.</p>

  <p>In travelling from Bluefields to Savannah le Mar, we save about two
    miles by taking what is called the Short Cut, a bridle-path through
    the deep matted woods. The trees are largely sweet-wood, tangled, near
    the edges of the broad morass, which occupies so much of this plain,
    by spreading bushes of black-withe and cockspur. Two streams are to be
    forded, the one a sluggish water that crosses the path immediately on
    our entering the woods, the other is the deep and rapid Sweet River.
    After <span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>pursuing for more than a mile the track through the bush,
    which here and there opens on each side into secluded grassy glades,
    adorned with many flowers, and haunted by gay butterflies, the gradual
    predominance of marsh plants, <i>sagittaria</i>, ginger-fern, bulrush,
    and black-withe, to the exclusion at length, of every thing else, warns
    us of our approach to the river, and at length we come suddenly upon it
    in all its beauty. Emerging darkly into view from beneath overhanging
    trees on the right, upon which is spread a thick drapery of convolvuli,
    whose lovely festoons, gemmed with purple and green, depend to the very
    surface of the water, the stream gurgles along a pebbly bed, or here
    and there glides with treacherous smoothness over quicksands hidden by
    the waving tresses of the dark green <i>equisetum</i>; and is presently
    lost again in the meandering of its tortuous course through the bushes.</p>

  <p>Many sorts of water-fowl haunt this darkling stream: scarlet-fronted
    Gallinules, that were feeding at the edge, alarmed at our approach,
    flutter along the surface with much splashing of the water and
    laborious flapping of their wings, to seek concealment; while the
    less timid, but more beautiful Sultana bridles its purple neck, and
    peeps at us from the shadow of the overarching withes, or walks calmly
    away over the shallows. The harsh scream of the Little Bittern comes
    fitfully from the reedy morass, and the cry of the Clucking-hen from
    its watch-post above; the little Squat-ducks are diving in the eddies
    of the stream, the Blue Kingfisher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span> darts across with his rattling
    call, while the snowy form of the White Gaulin is seen in the distance,
    relieved against the dark bushes, as it drags its heavy flight across
    the swamp. All the while gushes of rich melody are pouring from the
    throats of a dozen Mocking-birds around, soothing us as we recline on
    the soft beds of thyme that profusely cover the bank and fill the air
    with delicious fragrance.</p>

  <p>It was in this situation that Sam found the little Crake before us, on
    the 30th of March. It was at first standing at the edge of the stream,
    whence it ran up the large marsh-fern, vulgarly known as Wild-ginger,
    and peeped from among the fronds, until the lad shot it. It was a
    male. I found in its stomach, which was not very muscular, merely
    a little yellowish mucus, and some small gravel. We never met with
    the species again. I suspect, however, it is a permanent inhabitant
    of the morasses; but the impenetrable character of these sombre and
    fœtid recesses, renders an acquaintance with their inhabitants very
    difficult. The swiftness of foot, and the retiring habits of most of
    these birds, as well as their nocturnal rather than diurnal activity,
    add to this difficulty. The naturalist is often indebted for his
    knowledge of a species to “the fortune of the hour,” more than to his
    own efforts. Hence, I have no doubt, many birds of this tribe, unknown
    to me, exist in Jamaica.</p>

  <p>A specimen of this little Crake was brought to me in April, alive and
    unhurt. It lived in a cage two days, but though I enclosed with it a
    vessel containing water and mud, with aquatic weeds in a growing state,
    and scattered on it crumbs of bread and pounded corn, it scarcely ate.
    Once or twice I observed it picking in the mud, but in general it would
    not even walk on it. Yet it was not at all timid. Its motions were very
    deliberate; slowly raising its large feet, and then setting them down,
    often without making a step. The neck was usually drawn in, short;
    and then it had little of the appearance of a Rail, but rather of a
    passerine bird; but when it walked, the neck was more or less extended
    horizontally, and now and then bridled up: the head was carried low.
    The throat was often in slight vibration, when standing still. I
    observed no flirting, nor erection of the tail.</p>

  <p>On two or three occasions, I have seen the species. Near the end of
    August, pursuing a White Gaulin <span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>in the morasses of Sweet River,
    several of these little Rails, one at a time, flew out from the low
    rushes before my feet, and fluttering along for a few yards, with a
    very laboured flight, dropped in the dense rush again. Their manner
    of flight, and their figure greatly resembled those of a chicken; the
    legs hung inertly down. I saw another in February, by the border of
    the River at the Short Cut, flying with the same feeble and laborious
    motion, from one tuft of herbage to another, whence it would not emerge
    till almost trodden on.</p>

  <p>I have not heard it utter any sound; but Robinson, in describing two
    that were brought to him alive in October, 1760, says, “their cry was
    very low, and resembled that of a Coot, when at a great distance.” He
    notices also their peculiar mode of flight, as well as their habit of
    squatting. “Several,” he observes, “were killed accidentally, by the
    negroes at work; as they are so foolish as to hide their heads, and,
    cocking up their rumps, think they are safe, when they are easily
    taken.” (MSS. iii. 112.) He says elsewhere, “The negroes in Clarendon
    call it <em>Cacky-quaw</em>, by reason of its cry, which consists of
    three articulations; the negroes in Westmoreland call it <em>Johnny
    Ho</em>, and <em>Kitty Go</em>, for the same reason.” (iii. 134.)</p>

  <p>The gizzard of the one that I examined, contained a few hard seeds. The
    body is much compressed.</p>

  <p>The speckled plumage, rufous neck, and scarlet eyes, constitute this a
    species of much beauty.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This magnificent bird is not uncommon in some of the lowland ponds and
    marshy rivers of Jamaica. The road from Savannah le Mar to Negril,
    passes through the immense swamp of the Cabarita River, the tall and
    dense rushes of which form a wall on each side of the way, which in
    the wet season is overflowed. Riding there one day in January, I saw
    a Sultana walking in the middle of the road; a horseman had passed an
    instant before, who certainly had not disturbed it; and on my approach
    it took no more notice than a common fowl, sauntering about, and
    picking here and there; allowing me to come within three or four feet
    of it. I stopped and gazed at it, and at length made a noise and a
    sudden motion with my hands; but it merely half-opened the wings, and
    gave a little start, exactly as a chicken would do, but <span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>neither flew
    nor ran. I never saw a bird, <i>feræ naturæ</i>, so tame.</p>

  <p>I afterwards found that this vast morass abounded with them, and that
    their presence in the high road was a thing of daily occurrence; and
    though I never saw them <em>quite</em> so fearless as the one I have
    mentioned, still they were very bold, walking out from the rushes and
    strolling across the road in the sight of passengers.</p>

  <p>The aspect of the living bird is not that of a Gallinule; it stands
    high on the legs, which are placed more forward: its air is much like
    that of a fowl, but its contour is much slenderer. As it walks, the
    neck is bridled up, and thrown forward alternately, and the short black
    and white tail, which is semi-erect, is, at every step, flirted up with
    a jerk into a perpendicular position.</p>

  <p>I was struck with the remarkable elegance of one, that I saw by the
    roadside, about mid-way between Savanna le Mar and Bluefields. It was
    at one of those pieces of dark water called Blue-holes, reputed to
    be unfathomable. The surface was covered with the leaves and tangled
    stems of various water-plants, and on these the Sultana was walking,
    supported by its breadth of foot; so that the leaves on which it trod
    sank only an inch or two, notwithstanding that the bird, according to
    its usual manner, moved with great deliberation, frequently standing
    still, and looking leisurely on either side. As it walked over to
    where the water was less encumbered, it became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span> more immersed, until
    it seemed to be swimming, yet even then, from the motion of its legs,
    it was evidently walking, either on the bottom, or on the yielding
    plants. At the margin of the pool, it stood some time, in a dark nook
    overhung by bushes, where its green and purple hues were finely thrown
    out by the dark background. I could not help thinking what a beautiful
    addition it would make to an ornamental water in an English park;
    and the more so, because its confiding tameness allows of approach
    sufficiently near to admire its brilliancy. Nor are its motions void
    of elegance: the constant jerking of its pied tail is perhaps rather
    singular than admirable, but the bridling of its curved and lengthened
    neck, and the lifting of its feet are certainly graceful.</p>

  <p>That the Sultana could be easily domesticated is probable: Mr. Hill
    once kept one for three months, which fed eagerly on Guinea-corn
    (<i>Holcus sorghum</i>).</p>

  <p>The immense length of the toes in this bird is a wise and beautiful
    provision for its support on the aquatic herbage, which usually covers
    the surface of standing waters in warm countries. Xenophon, in the
    Retreat of the Ten Thousand, if I mistake not, has mentioned a country,
    where they were in the habit of affixing hurdles to the horses’ hoofs,
    to enable them to cross rivers without sinking. This device, however,
    could be available only on a weedy surface.</p>

  <p>Robinson, who has a drawing of this species, says, “This is called the
    true Plantain Coot, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span> reason of his great affection for that fruit.”
    In describing what he calls the Carpenter Coot, which seems merely
    the present bird in immature plumage, he says, “It has its name from
    the noise it makes; it being customary for these birds to assemble,
    and knock against pieces of felled timber with their beaks, either in
    search of insects, or <em>to break the shells of the water-snails</em>,
    which are common in the ponds and rivers of these parts. The noise they
    make when thus busied has been not badly likened to that of carpenters
    at work. And I am deceived if the Clucking-hen makes not a like noise,
    and for a similar purpose. I have been since credibly informed they do.
    The Carpenter Coot lays in March, and has young in April.” (MSS.)</p>

  <p>On taking off the skin, one is struck to observe the bases of all the
    feathers projecting from the interior surface, to an extent seen in no
    other birds than those of this genus.</p>

  <p>By a confusion of terms this species is called in Jamaica the Coot,
    while the following is known by the name of Water-hen.</p>

  <p>This bird is scarcely to be distinguished from the European Moor-hen,
    in appearance or in manners. It delights in any water where there is
    cover; sometimes a swiftly running stream, as Sweet River, where the
    bushes dip their branches into the water, or the margins are fringed
    with high weeds; but more usually large ponds, in which tall and
    thick bulrushes densely grow, or masses of the great ginger-fern. On
    approaching such a piece of water early in the morning, or at any hour
    of the day, if the place be unfrequented, we may see the Gallinules
    playing on the surface, some by their black plumage and scarlet
    shields, known to be females, the browner males less dressy, as becomes
    their sex, and some smaller and greyer, which are young. As they swim
    to and fro, they utter a loud <em>cluck</em> at short intervals; but on
    alarm each one sounds the note in a higher key, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>the whole company
    dashes into the cover. Here they continue to call to one another; but
    if much pressed, they lie close, or conceal themselves in some way, so
    as to elude search even in a very small area; probably by keeping under
    water, holding on the roots of the rushes. But if the observer remain
    quite silent and concealed, in about half an hour the <em>cluck</em> is
    again raised, and they begin cautiously to re-emerge, and play at the
    margin of the reeds. I think the sense of sight is less acute with them
    than that of hearing.</p>

  <p>One which I slightly wounded, on my carrying it by the legs, repeatedly
    turned up its head to bite; its force, however, was insufficient
    to break the skin, though it could pinch a little. Another in
    similar circumstances, I also found vicious in its attempts, though
    ineffective. On arriving at home, I wished to observe its manners in
    the water more closely, and for this purpose I fastened a cord to its
    foot, having bandaged it to prevent its being hurt or cut, and then
    let it swim in the pools of Bluefields River. Its first impulse was to
    dive, and then to swim along about a foot beneath the surface, which it
    did for a considerable distance, aiding its progress by striking out,
    not only the feet, but also the wings, which were expanded. It thus
    reminded me of a turtle. When immerged, the whole plumage was coated
    with a pellicle of air, which had a singular and beautiful effect. When
    it swam at the surface, little of the body but the back was exposed,
    and sometimes only the neck and head. It made constant efforts to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
    reach the weeds and grass at the margins, and if allowed to do so,
    crept in among them, and remained motionless. Sometimes, when thus
    retired, it put its whole head beneath the water, and remained still,
    so long that I feared it was drowned; but on being touched, it raised
    its head uninjured. It seemed unwilling to walk; perhaps because its
    legs were stiff, from having been held in the hand; on a boarded floor,
    it could only shuffle along on its belly: and on the turf, it seemed
    capable of maintaining a walking posture only as long as its motion
    was rapid; the moment its speed abated, its breast came to the ground,
    owing to the backward position of its legs. Its fœcal discharges, when
    first secured, were a thin black mud, but afterwards were merely a
    clear water, slightly tinged with green.</p>

  <p>The belly in these birds is always protuberant; the intestines being
    both very long and very large; the cæca are also enormous. The stomach,
    a very large and muscular gizzard, is usually filled, as well as the
    craw and intestine, with a greenish earth, which under a lens is seen
    to contain much organized matter, as minute seeds, decaying leaves,
    &amp;c. From the circumstance of an excessive quantity of matter being
    taken into the stomach, containing a comparatively small proportion of
    nutritive substance, we see the need of the digestive organs being both
    capacious and lengthened.</p>

  <p>The young of the season have the legs and feet of their full size and
    development, while the feathers of the wings are only beginning to
    protrude;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span> showing how subordinate the organs of flight are to those of
    swimming.</p>

  <p>Early in December we found an egg in Mount Edgecumbe pond, undoubtedly
    of this species, for no other large bird frequents it. It was larger
    than a hen’s egg, but more regularly oval: and appeared to have been of
    a pale blue tint, but covered with a coat of white chalky substance. It
    was lying on some crushed reeds at the surface, but evidently had been
    floating a long time, for it was discoloured, and the contents were
    coagulated by decomposition.</p>

  <p>In the immense morass behind Savanna le Mar, the dense rushes afford
    shelter to innumerable aquatic birds, among which one may recognise,
    even at a distance, the Sultanas by their graceful air and slender
    form, the Gallinules by their scarlet shields, and the Coots by their
    conspicuous ivory beaks. In the broad spaces of open water, which
    here and there margin the reeds, as at Radonda, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>they may be seen at
    all hours of the day, if undisturbed, hundreds congregated within an
    acre. Wary, however, to an excess, the distant sight of a man, or the
    snapping of the twigs beneath his tread, alarms the whole, and away
    they flutter into the covert, splashing the surface as they go. Yet
    the noise made by the cattle walking on the shore, or trampling and
    munching the reeds, as they wade breast-high, has no such effect. The
    best way to shoot them is to lie very quiet, if the musquitoes will
    allow you, behind a bush, and take them as they come out, sometimes two
    or three at a shot; or else to wade in among the reeds, and bring them
    down as they rise; though sometimes you cannot flush them. A good water
    dog is indispensable to success.</p>

  <p>As far as my observation goes, the white shield is the mark of mature
    age: in the young it is dark brown; I have not seen any with the shield
    wholly white, the upper part still being brown. After having been
    carried head downward for some time, I found the beak of one, instead
    of white, livid purple, as if filled with blood. The stomachs usually
    contain small seeds, and decaying vegetable matter mixed with mud and sand.</p>

  <p>This beautiful and singular bird first fell under my observation in
    December. It was wading in the water of Crab-pond, picking from the mud
    at the bottom, with the beak, the water reaching not quite half-way up
    the tarsus. It did not feel with the beak in the manner of the Snipe,
    but struck at the prey that caught its eye, as it walked with the head
    erect. The statement of Cuvier that walking is painful to this bird,
    is as contrary to fact as to reason. This specimen was walking in the
    shallow firmly enough; and even when shot in one leg so as to break
    it, it stood for some time on the other in a firm erect attitude, the
    broken limb being held up and dangling.</p>

  <p>Three were shot at Bluefields Creek on the 1st of May, in the evening,
    out of a large flock that were wading on the little bar at the
    mouth,—and were brought to me. One which had the wing broken was alive,
    and otherwise unhurt. It <span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>ran actively enough, without the slightest
    vacillation, taking long strides; but when it was on its belly, it
    could not get on its legs without help, sprawling about with opened
    wings: it is quite likely, however, that this was owing to one wing
    being rendered useless, for in attempting to rise, I perceived, it
    always tried to balance itself by opening and extending horizontally
    the wings. Probably this is the compensation given to it by the Allwise
    Creator, for the want of purchase which must be felt in raising the
    body at the end of levers, so long and so slender as the legs. It
    frequently stopped abruptly, essayed to go on, and stopped again, in
    that hesitating manner common to the Plovers; and like them it often
    jerked the head up and down. Its usual attitude, when standing still,
    was with the neck shortened, so that the head projected from between
    the shoulders, the beak pointing obliquely downwards, and the hinder
    parts of the body a little elevated. Now and then it lifted one foot,
    and held it dangling behind the other for a few seconds. Once or twice
    I saw it pick at the floor, and probably it took a small insect. Its
    cry, which was uttered once or twice, was a short <em>clank</em>, loud,
    harsh, and abrupt. I cannot by any means agree with Wilson, that this
    bird manifests no resemblance to the Plovers.</p>

  <p>The stomachs of these contained a few small shells, <i>Turbo</i> and
    <i>Nerita</i>: two which Robinson dissected contained “a kind of
    <i>Cornu-ammonis</i>,” probably <i>Planorbis</i>. He notices also, what
    I have not seen mentioned in print, but which was conspicuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span> enough
    in my specimen, a beautiful rosy blush on the white of the neck and
    breast; but only in the male. The females had eggs in the ovary at this
    time, (1st May) as large as pigeon-shot. They were all very fat, the
    fat being of a deep yellow hue.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hill has favoured me with the following notes on this species: “In
    addition to the extraordinary length of leg of the <i>Himantopus</i>,
    it has been asserted that its leg-bones are as limber as a leathern
    thong, and that they can be bent up without being broken. The accurate
    Wilson has made this statement. I will not merely say that it is at
    variance with my experience, but that it is absolutely absurd. The
    bones of this bird are as rigid as those of any other. [To this I add
    also my own testimony.] The only peculiarity I observe in them, is a
    flatness in the make of the leg. While the measurement is a fourth of
    an inch one way, it is scarcely an eighth of an inch the other. The
    tendon that runs all along the limb is very large, and the skin that
    envelopes the whole leg very fleshy. A fleshy feeling of softness is
    <em>the only approach</em> to the leathery peculiarity so confidently
    spoken of. The bill has a trifling trace, almost imperceptible, of
    recurvature. It is very rigid. Out of sixteen or eighteen birds
    carefully examined, I saw only one with a very decidedly marked
    recurved character. There was another circumstance I observed, very
    worthy of notice; viz. that the length of the legs of no two birds was
    precisely the same. Nearly half an inch of difference was found between
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span> tibia and tarsus of the longest, and of the shortest specimens.
    [My own observation <em>fully</em> bears out this statement.]</p>

  <p>“The birds brought me were shot while feeding in some shallow pools of
    water in the Salines at Passage Fort. They were wading deeply. They fed
    in small flocks, and winged about sportively, mingled with Sandpipers
    of the <i>Tringa cinerea</i> species. A variety of Teal were there
    also; and the Shoveler Duck (<i>Rhynchaspis clypeata</i>), a peculiar
    insect-feeder, being among them at the same time, makes us pretty
    distinctly acquainted with the food of <i>Himantopus</i>.</p>

  <p>“In March 1842, I noticed several Stilt Plovers fishing breast-high in
    a lakelet at the mouth of the Rio Cobre, which I used to look upon from
    the window of the dwelling I stayed at, at Passage Fort. I saw some
    eight or ten together, when a Kingfisher was fishing at one end of the
    pond, and an Osprey at the other; the Kingfisher confining himself to
    the tranquil stream, and the Osprey to the broken waters, where the
    current of the river contended with the shoaling sea. I saw the Stilts
    there an hour together, beating breast-high over the pond. It was
    evident that their food floated on the surface.”</p>

  <p>The dimensions given below are from a specimen shot on the beach at
    Negril, in March 1764; from the Doctor’s description, it seems to have
    been scarcely mature. He adds, “I once saw a living one at Kingston.
    Its food was white bread steeped in water in a washing basin. In
    feeding, it immerged its upper mandible in the bottom of the basin,
    resting on the elbow or angle of that mandible, and by quick repeated
    motions, like those of a duck in the mud, sucked up the finest parts of
    the dissolving bread.”</p>

  <p>As I have never met with this beautiful bird in Jamaica, I am the
    more obliged for the following memoir from the pen of my kind friend,
    Mr. Hill. “I believe the Flamingo is never seen now upon our coasts,
    but as a solitary bird, or, at most, associated with three or four
    companions, when they make excursions in small groups, preparatory
    to pairing <span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>and breeding. The congregated flocks of the neighbouring
    islands disperse themselves; and stragglers appear upon the sand-bars
    at the mouths of our rivers, occasionally, in seasons remarkable for
    visits of the Hyperborean and the Canada Goose. We are best acquainted
    with them as inhabitants of Cuba. The waters between the thinly peopled
    shores of that island, and the clustered green kays of the coast, to
    which Columbus gave the names of the Gardens of the King and Queen,
    are low and shoaly. In these shallow seas, in adjacent swamps, in
    river-lakes, in marshes and lagoons, and salina-ponds, they are to be
    always seen moving in flocks, or flying and feeding in ranks of two
    and three hundred together. Their lengthened lines and red plumage
    have led the colonial Spaniards to call them <em>English soldiers</em>,
    a name not inappropriate to birds that marshal themselves under a
    leader, and regulate their movements by signals, when the remotest
    danger threatens; and obey the bugle-blast of their sentinel, when he
    summons the cohorts to the wing, and to betake themselves to other
    feeding-grounds.</p>

  <p>“I visited the district of Boyamo on the south side of Cuba in the
    year 1821, and was on the coast from January to April. I was much
    among the marshes and swamps about the river Conta, a stream that
    receives the tidal waters, which here rise and fall six or seven feet,
    at fifty miles along its course. At the mouth of this river there are
    long stretches of shoal ground, where the floods of the river and the
    sea form lakelets, and successively deposit their stores of living
    atoms, with the rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span> and falling tides. Here the Flamingoes flock
    and feed. They arrange themselves in <em>what seem to be lines</em>, in
    consequence of their finding their food along the <em>edges</em> of these
    shallows; and though it is true that whilst their heads are down, and
    they are cluttering with their bills in the water, they have one of
    their number on the watch, standing erect, with his long neck turning
    round to every point, ready to sound the alarm on the apprehension of
    danger,—what appears to be a studied distribution of themselves back
    to back, as some observers describe their arrangement, is nothing but
    their regardless turning about in their places, inwardly and outwardly,
    at a time when all are intent on making the most of the stores which
    the prolific waters are yielding.</p>

  <p>“The vessel I was with on the coast of Cuba was loading timber. Our
    raftsmen brought us from Juanita, a town on the Rio Conta to which the
    tidal influences of the sea extend, a pair of Flamingoes. I was struck
    with their attitudes, with the excellent adaptation of their two-fold
    character of waders and swimmers, to their habits, while standing and
    feeding in the sort of shoal which we made them in a large tub upon
    deck. We were here able to observe their natural gait and action. With
    a firm erectness, like a man treading a wine press, they trod and
    stirred the mashed biscuits, and junked fish, with which we fed them;
    and plied their long lithe necks, scooping with their heads reversed,
    and bent inwardly towards their trampling feet. The bill being crooked,
    and flattened for accommodation to this reversed mode of feeding, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
    the head is thrust down into the mud-shoals and the sand drifts, the
    upper bill alone touches the ground. The structure of the tongue, of
    which Professor Owen has given so minute and interesting a description,
    is admirably adapted for a mode of feeding altogether peculiar. The
    spines with which the upper surface is armed, are arranged in an
    irregular and alternate series, and act with the notches on the edge of
    the upper mandible, on which they press when the bird feeds with the
    head reversed. In this reversed position, the weight and size of the
    tongue becomes a very efficient instrument for entrapping the food. The
    bird muddles, and clatters the bill, and dabbles about, and the tongue
    receives and holds as a strainer whatever the water offers of food.</p>

  <p>“When I made my notes of the Flamingo, thought I had remarked what
    had hitherto been unobserved, respecting the ceaseless trampling of
    the feet while feeding; but I find Catesby has described it.... A
    correspondent of Buffon’s also, I perceive, communicated the same fact,
    with other incidents equally striking....</p>

  <p>“There is nothing of the Heron character in the Flamingo. Extraordinary
    length of neck and legs is common to both, but a firm erect posture is
    its ordinary standing attitude. The neck is never curved inward and
    outward, convex and concave, like a Crane’s, but its movements are in
    long sweeping curves, which are peculiarly pleasing, when the bird is
    preening its plumage.</p>

  <p>“The bar at the mouth of the Rio Conta stretches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span> some two miles and
    a half out to sea, with a narrow inlet about nine feet deep at high
    water. Here the Flamingoes, at the season when they associate in
    flocks, are congregated by hundreds. They feed divided into the lines
    I have explained already, and subdivided into companies. A scout on
    some advantageous point apart, where he may glance alternately at the
    lengthened reach of the river, and at the sweeping sinuosities of the
    coast, right and left, sounds his orders to the squadron. A sort of
    long-drawn trumpet-call is the signal of danger. At the warning to
    retreat, the whole troop rise on the wing crying and screaming. They
    fly in a stiff cruciform posture, with the neck extended swan-like, and
    the legs depending, but stretched behind so as to balance the flight.
    When thus suddenly alarmed, they rise to the height of the belt of
    mangroves that close in some neighbouring lagoon, and clearing the
    fringing woodland, drop within the impervious wilderness, and then feed
    no longer congregated, but dispersed about.”</p>

  <p>Robinson states that “the flesh is tough: they skin them and boil
    them. The broth is very good and rich. The fat of the bird being
    orange-coloured, like that of the Great White Curlew, gives it a very
    agreeable and rich appearance.” The Doctor also observes, “The body
    appears <em>depressed, not compressed as the Ardeæ</em>.” (MSS.)</p>

  <p>The Whistling Duck is well known in Jamaica, by the singular note
    which has conferred on it its provincial name. This note uttered in
    its crepuscular flights to and from its feeding-places, and also when
    alarmed, is peculiarly shrill, and bears no small resemblance to the
    sound produced by blowing forcibly over the pipe of a drawer-key.</p>

  <p>It is much dreaded by those who plant Guinea-corn; in February, when
    this grain is <em>in the milk</em>, the ducks in a compact flock dash
    forcibly into the corn, striking down a large breadth, on which they
    can stand, and eat the soft grain at ease. But for this impetus, they
    could have no means of reaching the panicle, from its loftiness; nor of
    bringing down the stalk with their beaks, from its firmness: nor, from
    its slenderness, would their arboreal habits avail them to perch on it.
    Numerous flocks of both young and old birds, frequent the millet-fields
    from December till the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>end of February, when this corn is reaped. They
    are most busy in their depredations on moonlight nights; and as they
    sweep round in circles, their remarkable whistle always betrays their
    movements.</p>

  <p>The young are frequently taken, and brought up in the poultry yard with
    the tame ducks, either pinioned, or sufficiently subdued by kindness
    to be allowed liberty. These are always found to attract large flocks
    of their wild brethren to the farm-ponds, and are often preserved for
    that purpose. The tame birds, which are allowed to roam, even go to
    a considerable distance in search of the wild flocks, and bring them
    home. Some, with which Mr. Hill was familiar near Spanish Town, always
    led the whole flock of aquatic poultry, invariably marching at their
    head, when called from the pond to be fed, and when fed, returning in
    the same order to the water again.</p>

  <p>A gentleman of Spanish Town informs me that the nest of this bird is
    usually at the foot of a mangrove, and that it lays eight or nine
    eggs. Robinson, however, gives it a different mode of nidification,
    having been informed by Mr. Thistlewood of Savanna le Mar, a copious
    contributor to his ornithological notes, that “the Whistling Ducks
    sometimes make their nests in hollow trees above thirty feet in height,
    and the hollows or cavities several feet deep, which makes him at a
    loss to know by what method the little ducklings either get up the
    hollow, or down the tree when up; but he thinks the old one must carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
    them; and I believe this must be soon after they are hatched; for I
    cannot suppose she can carry food and water for them into such a place;
    it being not known that any birds of this kind ever feed their young.
    [See Wilson, on the Summer Duck.] However, I believe the young ducks
    may <em>jump</em> out of such a cavity; for a day or two after they have
    been hatched, they have been known to jump out of a barrel, and far
    above that height.” (MSS. ii. 85.)</p>

  <p>“The Whistling Duck endeavours to save her young, when pursued, by
    throwing herself into the man’s way; that is, by rushing up so close
    to him as to draw his attention, that her young, who are very active,
    may have an opportunity of escaping. Accordingly, the man, seeing the
    duck so near him, looking upon her as a much better prize than the
    young ones, leaves pursuing the ducklings, and endeavours to catch
    the subtil dame, who runs before, but takes special care to keep out
    of his reach; yet stopping in front of him, occasionally, to make him
    renew the pursuit, till the young are entirely out of danger; when she
    flies away, leaving her pursuer to fret at his double disappointment.
    This I had from a person of credit, who affirmed that himself was thus
    deceived. The Whistling Duck is very hard to catch, if its wing only is
    disabled; and will outrun a man, if he be not very nimble.</p>

  <p>“The Whistling Duck breeds numerous in the morasses of Westmoreland;
    in such places they remain all day, and in the evening disperse
    themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span> over the ponds in the open plains to feed, till near
    morning, when they return. It is usual for people to watch for them in
    the evening, when they go to feed, and to shoot them. When the gunner
    hears them whistling in their flight, he imitates the sound, and thus
    lures them to where he is, and, of course, to their destruction. A duck
    and mallard with their young brood commonly fly together.” (Rob. MSS.)</p>

  <p>Mr. Swainson’s conjectures that this is the male of the Red-billed
    species, (Anim. in Menag. p. 223.) and also that it is the female
    (Ibid. p. 224.) are both groundless. The Red-bill is perfectly
    distinct; and the sexes of the present species do not differ from each
    other. The difference in depth of the warm brown tint on the belly and
    chin is common to both sexes. The trachea is terminated by a trilateral
    bony capsule, where the bronchi divaricate. There is but one pair of
    tracheal muscles. The feet-webs are so concave, as to be little more
    than semi-palmate.</p>

  <p>It is very common in Hayti, where its Indian name, <i>Iguasa</i>, is
    adopted by the Spaniards.</p>

  <p>All Ducks are fond of shaking their tails and their feathers, but
    in the Whistling Ducks of both species, from their height, this is
    particularly conspicuous.</p>

  <p class="p2">The Red-billed Whistling Duck (<i>D. Autumnalis</i>) though much less
    common in Jamaica than the preceding, is found there in some seasons,
    as an autumnal visitant from the Spanish-main. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span> seen several in
    a state of domestication, allowed to run in a yard at Kingston, but
    they had been imported.</p>

  <p>I have ventured to give a name to the magnificent Duck described below,
    notwithstanding the opinion of so high an authority as Mr. G. R. Gray,
    who, on inspecting my specimen, considered it a hybrid. Though I have
    the greatest respect for the judgment of that gentleman, I cannot
    feel quite free from doubt on the subject for the following reasons.
    At Radonda water, near Savanna le Mar, where my specimen was shot, it
    seemed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>well known to the negro gunners, who had been accustomed to
    call it <em>Wigeon</em>, and who stated that others had been lately (at
    the end of February) seen in the neighbouring waters.</p>

  <p>Robinson was acquainted with this identical species, (or variety?)
    nearly a hundred years ago. “Mr. Thistlewood shot a Duck and Drake,
    which he called the Wild Muscovy Duck and Drake, <em>not on account</em>
    of their resembling those birds in colour, but in size, for the Drake
    equalled the Muscovy Drake, and the Duck the Muscovy Duck. The Wild
    Muscovy Duck, Mr. T. says, was covered with a most elegant, beautiful
    plumage, far surpassing that of any bird of this kind he ever saw.”
    (MSS. ii. 86.) From an elaborate description and admeasurement, which
    the Doctor afterwards gives, I find the male <em>agrees accurately</em>
    with mine, save that its expanse was 48 inches, and its tail 7&#189;, the
    extremity being curled upwards. <em>The female</em> also was shot, but
    dived and escaped: it was in the great pond at Egypt, (close to which
    mine was obtained,) November 19th, 1753.</p>

  <p>I leave the question thus; merely adding that the trachea of mine, (a
    male) terminated in a large pear-shaped bony capsule, on the left side.
    The stomach contained hard seeds of sedges, with some vegetable fibre.
    The testes were comparatively small.</p>

  <p>This is one of the ducks which, being in high estimation for sapidity,
    are largely brought to market in the towns. My acquaintance with it is
    indeed confined to this condition. Robinson notices it, as frequently
    met with in the wet months. He saw one in the yard of Edward Long,
    Esq., of Spanish Town, where it fed amongst the poultry: “it was
    coloured like that painted in Mr. Catesby’s History of Carolina, i. p.
    100, and was known to be a female by having laid an egg, though Mr.
    Catesby says the female is all over brown.” (MSS. ii. 120) Robinson
    agrees with Browne in considering this a permanent inhabitant of
    Jamaica, having known them shot, even during the dry season.</p>

  <p>Of those which I examined, the stomachs contained coarse siliceous
    sand, and small black seeds; the œsophagus of one contained several
    small fishes.</p>

  <p>The Teal which from the absence of the white crescent in both sexes,
    I have thus named, is well known in Jamaica, and has probably been
    mistaken for the female of <i>discors</i>, with which it associates.
    Its manners are said to be identical with those of its congener. It
    much resembles <i>C. Fretensis</i> of Eyton, but has not the broad
    yellow spot on the beak, nor the barred flanks.</p>

  <p>The stomachs of such as I have dissected, contained small seeds,
    and coarse sand. One was brought me alive in March; its voice, when
    alarmed, was a very subdued hissing, like that of a goose, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>but very
    softly. I have met with this species only in Spanish Town.</p>

  <p>The eastern point of Old Harbour is occupied by a salt-morass,
    immediately opposite Goat Island, which affords the principal supply
    of Ducks to the Spanish Town market; and more particularly since the
    construction of the railway has driven the birds from Passage Fort.
    The morass borders the little cove called Galleon Harbour, and extends
    over a small projecting peninsula, where it is cut into natural
    channels, intersecting each other at right angles, through which the
    sea flows, which are almost as regular as if cut by art. The surf,
    driven through them by the sea-breeze, and the frequent passage of
    boats, keep these singular canals open, and prevent the growth in them
    of the mangroves, which are perpetually throwing out their bow-like
    roots, and encroaching on every unoccupied space. It is at the open
    <em>pans</em> formed by the intersection of the canals, that the Ducks
    of various species congregate: when the gunners approaching in boats
    up the canals, come suddenly upon the flocks, and taking them in
    <i>enfilade</i>, bring down numbers at a shot.</p>

  <p>In a broad piece of water near Radonda, which is crossed by the high
    road from Savanna le Mar to Negril, and which is connected with the
    vast morass that lies behind the former town, I have seen these
    curious little Ducks. Rarely more than three are visible at one time,
    scattered over the water, often very near the road. They pay very
    little attention to passing travellers; but if one stop and gaze at
    them, they take alarm, and sink the body lower into the water, until
    the back is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>level with the surface. If they suspect danger, they
    gradually sink wholly under water; and if suddenly alarmed they thus
    immerse themselves in a moment, <em>not diving</em> as other water birds
    do, <em>but sinking as they sit</em>, causing scarcely a ruffle of the
    surface. I have found them excessively wary, and difficult to shoot;
    because if they come up and still suspect danger, they immediately
    sink again, and remain beneath an incredible while, even for several
    hours, unless they can manage to expose the nostrils to the surface
    without appearing. When they do rise, it is in the same noiseless,
    almost imperceptible manner, and in the same posture as they went down.
    Occasionally they fly, or rather flutter with much flapping of wings,
    and apparently painful exertion, across the pond, splashing the surface
    as they go; and I have seen one take a higher flight across the road
    to the lower water. When undisturbed, they sit long in one place, and
    spend a good deal of time in smoothing their plumage.</p>

  <p>The stomach of the specimen I obtained, a male, from which the
    description was taken, contained only seeds mostly comminuted.</p>

  <hr class="tb">

  <p>From a recent letter of Mr. Hill’s I extract the following notes. “We
    have certainly two if not three different Pond Ducks. With two I am
    familiarly acquainted. One is a very beautiful little bird, with such
    a prevalence of yellow and red ochre in the plumage, and with the
    usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span> crescent shaped ocellated markings of the Duck tribe, so dark,
    as to give it a very quail-like appearance. It has in consequence been
    commonly designated the Quail-duck.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The secondaries of the wing
    are white; the head is dappled black and ochry-white, and the bill is
    a brilliant cobalt-blue. The tail is stiff and curved upwards, with (I
    think) 16 black feathers which radiate broad and distinct, without any
    lapping of one feather over another. In the <em>nestling</em> bird the
    feathers are differently formed. They are unwebbed in the centre of
    the shaft, the terminal plumes being few, and curved like the Υ of the
    Greek alphabet.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_128" href="#FNanchor_128" class="label">[128]</a> Hence my friend proposes to name it <i>Erismatura
      ortygoides</i>.
  </div>

  <p>“The other is a short squat Duck, almost square in form, the breadth
    of its body being equal to its length, and uniformly coloured
    <em>wood-brown</em>;—a description of the plumage not perhaps very
    precise, but so much so with respect to the ordinary hue of the bark of
    trees, as to make it sufficiently indicative of the prevailing colour.
    The centre shafts of the tail of this bird terminate in long stiff
    spines, as stiff and as long as those of a horse-comb.</p>

  <p>“I shall not venture to say how far similarity of structure in the
    tail of the Erismaturine family of Ducks with that of the Cormorant,
    indicates a similarity in the application of this organ for diving
    purposes, as Mr. Eyton has conjectured; but a bird kept in a small
    pool in a flower garden, into which pond-weeds were daily thrown,
    particularly <i>chara</i> and duck-weed, (<i>pistiaceæ</i>) <span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>upon which
    it was supposed to feed, would lead me to think that one important
    purpose that this remarkably constructed organ was applied to, was to
    move aside the dense vegetation of shallow pools in which it fed. The
    habit of this bird was to turn round quick. By this motion it opened
    out the weeds on the surface, so graphically described by Shakspeare
    as ‘the green mantle of the standing pool,’—and made a clear space for
    ‘swithering with its neb,’ as Lincolnshire decoy-keepers would say. It
    dived frequently, and the period it remained submerged was prodigiously
    long. It swam backward as frequently as forward, and, I apprehend,
    found its peculiarly made tail a powerful lever in dilating the
    space behind it. The little garden, in which the bird was kept, that
    furnished me with these observations, was a fair representation of its
    natural haunts. Tufts of flowers, composed of lilies, kincalmias, and
    Indian-shot, with intermixtures of young vegetating bananas, were an
    apt substitute for the heliconias, nymphæas, cyperaceæ, juncales, and
    marantaceous plants, among which it delighted when wild and at large.
    It sometimes crept on the bank, and sheltered itself among the bowery
    herbage; but the clots of damp weed, strewn around its pond, were
    its favourite resting place when out of the water; and there it sat
    <em>crouching</em>, not sitting upright as the Grebe does. In its natural
    haunts it is occasionally flushed, but its flight is exceedingly short,
    not usually more than from the bank into the mantling herbage of the
    pond, where it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span> instantly disappears in those long submersions I have
    already noticed.”</p>

  <hr class="tb">

  <p>The remaining <i>Anatidæ</i> which have been observed in Jamaica,
    I shall dismiss with a bare enumeration, furnished by my esteemed
    friend to whom this work is so deeply indebted. Though some of them
    have fallen under my own notice, I have nothing to add to their known
    history. I treat them in this summary manner, the more willingly,
    because my friend is himself preparing for the press a treatise on the
    migratory birds of Jamaica, the fruit of many years’ close observation.</p>

  <p>The high-road from Bluefields to Savanna le Mar winds round the broad
    bend of the coast, called Bluefields Bay; for nearly half the distance,
    running close to the shore, which in some parts is a low sandy beach,
    in others, rocky and precipitous. About a mile from Bluefields the road
    recedes about a hundred yards from the sea, the intervening space being
    occupied by tall and dense wood, consisting chiefly of manchioneel,
    crablight, sweet-wood, and tropic-birch, much tangled by an underwood
    of briers and supple-jacks. As we approach the brow of the cliff, we
    perceive that the descent, just here, is not a perpendicular rock,
    but is a very steep slope, covered with a loose and shifting rubble,
    very unpleasant and even dangerous to the feet. Two enormous birches
    and a fig, at some distance from each other, springing out of the
    brow, spread their immense boughs even over the sea that boils among
    the rocks beneath; and the observer needs no informant to tell him
    that these trees are occupied as resting places by many large <span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>birds.
    The earth, and bushes, and rocks beneath, are splashed widely with
    white ordure, the fishy fetor of which is diffused all through the
    woods, and is but too perceptible even at the highroad. Scattered upon
    the ground lie the long bones, bleached in the wind, and the sable
    feathers, of several Frigate-birds, who met their death where they had
    been accustomed to live; the victims perhaps of disease, or perhaps
    of mutual encounters. High up on the loftiest and outmost limbs sit
    many Pelicans, some preening their plumage, others, with the long beak
    resting on the breast, enjoying a sluggish repose. Frigates and Boobies
    are associated with them, but of these we shall speak presently.</p>

  <p>From many visits to this place, which commonly goes by the name of the
    Pelican hole, I have observed that the Pelicans which resort hither,
    leave the roost at early dawn, and fish for two or three hours; they
    return about eight o’clock and rest on the roosting trees until about
    eleven; then they go abroad again and fish along the shore or sit
    lazily on the rocking sea, till dusk, when in long strings they fly
    wearily homeward, and spend the night upon their favourite trees.</p>

  <p>It is a pleasant sight to see a flock of Pelicans fishing. A dozen
    or more are flying on heavy, flagging wing over the sea, the long
    neck doubled on the back, so that the beak seems to protrude from
    the breast. Suddenly, a little ruffling of the water arrests their
    attention; and, with wings half-closed, down each plunges with a
    resounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span> plash, and in an instant emerges to the surface with a
    fish. The beak is held aloft, a snap or two is made, the huge pouch
    is seen for a moment distended, then collapses as before; and heavily
    the bird rises to wing, and again beats over the surface with its
    fellows. It is worthy of observation that the Pelican invariably
    performs a somerset under the surface; for descending, as he always
    does, diagonally, not perpendicularly, the head emerges looking in the
    opposite direction to that in which it was looking before. When the
    morning appetite is sated, they sit calmly on the heaving surface,
    looking much like a miniature fleet.</p>

  <p>In the evening, as I have stated, we see them pursuing their laborious
    course to repose. Standing at the door of Bluefields, which from a
    slight elevation, commands a wide prospect of the beautiful Bay, I
    have often watched, in the evening,—while the sun, sinking among his
    gilded piles and peaks of cloud on the horizon-sea, leaves the air
    refreshingly cool and balmy, while the dying sea-breeze scarcely avails
    to break the glassy reflection of the surface,—the straggling flocks of
    Pelicans, from a dozen to forty or fifty, passing slowly along over the
    shore. On such occasions, they manifest a decided tendency to form long
    continuous strings, like ducks. When the flocks are beating for fish,
    or sailing round and round on the watch, there is no such arrangement,
    but all circle in a confusion equal to that of the planets of the
    Ptolemaic system. Yet at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span> time of the day, in taking a lengthened
    flight, whether shifting their locality, or slowly sweeping over the
    sea, they usually take a lineal order.</p>

  <p>In flying thus in lines, I have been struck with the unity which
    they manifest in their motions: the flight is performed by alternate
    intervals of heavy flappings, and sailing on outstretched motionless
    wing; and the resumption or suspension of the one or the other state,
    is regulated by the leading bird of the line. For example; the first
    begins to flap; in an instant the second begins, then the third, then
    the fourth, and so on, with perfect regularity of succession; and
    neither ceases till the first does, and then only each in his own turn.
    That this does not depend on the period of each motion being constant,
    is shown by the fact, that the duration of either state is very varying
    and arbitrary. If a bird be following the same course, near at hand,
    but not within the line, he does not regard the succession at all, but
    governs his own motion.</p>

  <p>The Pelican on alighting on the water to swim, brings his feet, which
    before had been stretched out behind, into a standing position, and, as
    it were, <em>slides along the surface</em>, for several yards before he
    swims.</p>

  <p>Voracious and formidable as is the Pelican to the smaller of the finny
    races, he is not without his enemies among them. I once observed a
    large Shark gliding along at the surface of the water near a flock of
    swimming Pelicans, wilily endeavouring to approach some unwary one
    within seizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span> distance, his triangular dorsal cutting the water and
    revealing his progress, and his intentions. The Pelicans were alert,
    however, and did not choose a near acquaintance with their insidious
    admirer, each one rising into safety upon the wing as he approached. I
    fear he went without his supper on that occasion.</p>

  <p>The following interesting note, I quote from a valuable paper by
    Mr. Hill, “On the aerating powers of birds,” read at a meeting of
    the Jamaica Society, June 1st, 1840. “The facility with which the
    Pelican resigns itself to fasting, or rouses itself to feasting, was
    very interestingly exhibited to me in a bird, I saw the other day at
    Passage Fort. It was a domesticated Pelican, of mature age: it winged
    backward and forward, visiting the wild flocks, and feeding with them
    in the harbour during the day, and withdrew from them to roost in its
    master’s yard during the night. In that period of restraint, when it
    was necessary to observe the caution of drawing its quill feathers, to
    keep it within very diminished capabilities of flight, until it became
    familiar and domesticated, it was wholly dependent on the fish provided
    for it by the fishermen of the beach. Sunday was no fishing day with
    these men; and this was regularly a day on which there were no supplies
    for the Pelican. It became in time so conscious of the recurrence of
    this fast-day, that although at all other times it went daily down
    to the sea-side to wait the coming in of the canoes, on the seventh
    day it never stirred from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span> recumbent trunk of a tree on which it
    roosted within the yard. It had been found necessary to pluck its wing
    within the last two or three months to restrain it within bounds, in
    consequence of its absence latterly with the wild birds for several
    days in succession; and in this state it was reduced as formerly to
    depend on the fishermen for food. The old habit of abstinence and
    drowsy repose on the Sundays again recurred, and when I saw it, it was
    once more a tranquil observer of the rest, and with it the fast, of the
    Sabbath day.”</p>

  <p>Robinson describes one in captivity, as “a bold fierce bird, which
    would snap his beak not only at dogs and other small animals, but even
    at men and horses, that came inadvertently within his reach.” (MSS.)</p>

  <p>The Pelican is sometimes taken much in the same manner as Gannets in
    England. A fish is fastened to a board, which is swiftly drawn through
    the sea by a canoe under sail; the Pelican plunges down upon it, and
    breaks his neck with the violence of the contact. Although the beak is
    not pointed, but hooked at the extremity, Sam has assured me that it
    has been known to be driven through the soft wood of the cotton tree,
    when that has been used for the board. The flesh is eaten by some of
    the negroes, notwithstanding its insupportable fishy odour; to overcome
    which in some degree, they bury it for some hours in the sand of the
    beach, after which they subject it to three or four boilings before it
    is eaten.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span></p>

  <p>The term <i>fuscus</i> is but poorly applicable to this bird in adult
    plumage: the long and pointed feathers, being black with a central
    stripe of pure white, give a hue rather hoary or silvery than fuscous;
    and the pale yellow head, and deep chestnut neck, margined with a white
    edging, adds a considerable degree of beauty to the whole.</p>

  <p>I dissected a female in May; an operation which though performed in
    the open air, was almost sufficient to take away the breath. I found
    the stomach a long capacious sac without constriction, with thick
    muscular walls; there was a round cavity just beyond the pyloric bend;
    the intestinal canal was nearly uniform in size, slender, but long,
    with many convolutions; it measured 99 inches; near the middle was a
    curious conformation, which I have observed in the intestine of the
    <i>Ardeadæ</i>; as though the tube had been abruptly terminated and
    closed, and another tube <em>let in at the side</em> of the former a
    little way from the end, which end thus projected like a teat. Two
    cæca, about 1&#189; inch long when distended. The appearance of the
    viscera corresponded in most particulars to that described by Prof.
    Owen (Pr. Zool. Soc. 1835) in <i>P. rufescens</i>. The right lobe of
    the liver was three or four times greater in volume than the left;
    the former had its edges rounded; the latter was sub-globose. The
    gall-bladder small; the gall deep brown-yellow. The spleen was large,
    oval, about 1&#190; by 1&#188;, soft, and greenish-black. Kidneys about
    equal, 2 inches by 1 inch. The fat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span> about the viscera, which was in
    series of small lumps, was of a deep orange, or almost salmon-red. I
    may add that our species seems much more arboreal than that described
    by Prof. Owen. On bending the heel-joint, so as to bring the tarsus up
    towards the tibia, the toes were strongly incurved; and on my placing a
    stick beneath the toes, and then forcibly bending the heel, the stick
    was grasped with so much power that it could with difficulty be dragged
    away. I perceived from the form which the foot assumed under such
    circumstances, that the hind toe is opposed to the others in grasping
    or perching, notwithstanding their continuity of membrane; the web
    which connects the hind-toe being wide enough to admit an object like
    the branch of a tree, when the toes are opposed.</p>

  <p>The tongue is singularly minute; the <i>rami</i> of the hyoïd bone,
    passing on each side of the larynx, are simply enveloped in the
    membranes of the pouch, and at their convergence, there is a minute
    projecting point of cartilage about ¹⁄₆ inch long, which is the only
    apology for a tongue.</p>

  <p>I was astonished to observe that the whole inner surface of the skin on
    the trunk, was cellular, especially on the breast; composing an immense
    congeries of membranous cells, inflated with air. The pouch held
    seventeen pints of water, which when full dripped out at a wound <em>in
    the fore-arm</em>.</p>

  <p>The trees described in the preceding article as constituting the
    lodging place of the Pelicans, are frequented also, though less
    regularly, by a considerable number of these Boobies. They usually
    huddle together, in little groups, sitting closely side by side, so
    that four and five may frequently be brought down at a shot.</p>

  <p>I have invariably found the stomachs of those thus obtained, quite
    empty, and as the Frigate-birds assemble on the same trees, I
    conjecture that the Boobies examined had been compelled to disgorge the
    prey they had taken, by the assaults of their powerful neighbours: to
    avoid whose attacks, probably, they took refuge on the trees. As they
    sit, they frequently utter a loud croaking cackle.</p>

  <p>One which was disabled, manifested great ferocity, striking forcibly
    with the opened beak, endeavouring to pierce with its very acute
    points, as well as to cut with its keen saw-like edges. It had the
    sagacity to neglect a stick presented, and strike at the hand that held
    it; and my <span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>fingers could testify to the lacerating power of their
    formidable weapon.</p>

  <p>The tails of all the specimens that fell into my hands, were much worn
    at the extremity; probably from incubation on the rocks. The use of
    the very singular pectination of the middle toe, was indicated, by
    its being choked up in each one with down. The great length of the
    body in these birds is particularly observable when the integuments
    are removed. In one specimen, I found lying among the folds of the
    intestines, a tape-worm, about three feet in length.</p>

  <hr class="tb">

  <p>The above is the only <i>Sula</i> that we know anything of, about the
    coast of Westmoreland; but Mr. Hill has identified three others from
    the Pedro Kays, some of which appear to frequent the little Kays of
    the coast near Kingston. I believe they are the <i id="Sula_fiber">Sula fiber</i>, or
    drab-coloured Booby, <i id="Sula_piscator">S. piscator</i>, or White Booby, and <i id="Sula_parva">S.
    parva</i>, or Black and white Booby. Of this last Mr. Hill has a pair
    domesticated, of whose habits he has favoured me with the following
    pleasing notes.</p>

  <p>“The sympathy shewn by gregarious birds for their wounded companions
    is usually never more strongly manifested than in the Boobies. In the
    wanton sport of shooting at them when sailing past the kays and islets
    they resort to, there are few who have not witnessed the extraordinary
    efforts made by the clamorous flock to assist a wounded bird, when
    fluttering in the water, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span> unable to regain the wing. An accident
    which happened to one of the two Boobies we have in our yard, gave us
    an opportunity of seeing traits of this feeling, and of its attendant
    emotions. My little nephew, in chasing with a small whip one of our
    birds, entangled the lash about its wing, and snapped the arm-bone.
    The one bird not alone shewed sympathy for the other, but exhibited
    curiosity about the nature and character of the accident. Our two birds
    are male and female. The wounded Booby withdrew into a lonely part of
    the yard, and stood there drooping. The female sought him as soon as
    she heard his cry of agony, and after ascertaining, by surveying him
    all round, that the injury was in the wing, proceeded to prevail on him
    to move the limb, that she might see whether he was really disabled
    beyond the power of using it for flight. After a quacking <em>honk</em>
    or two, as a call to do something required of him, the female stretched
    out one of her wings;—the wounded male imitated her, and, making an
    effort, moved out, in some sort of way, the wounded member to its
    full length. He was now required by a corresponding movement to raise
    it:—he raised the broken arm, but the wing could not be elevated. The
    curiosity of the female was at a standstill. After a moment’s pause,
    her wounded companion was persuaded to make another trial at imitation,
    and to give the wings some three or four good flaps. He followed the
    given signal, gave the required beats upon the air with so thorough a
    good will, to meet the wishes of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span> curious mate, that he twirled
    the broken wing quite round, and turned it inside out. The mischief
    was prodigiously increased. It was now necessary to put a stop to this
    process of investigation of the one bird into the misfortune of the
    other. I came in just as these exhibitions had occurred, and taking up
    the bird with its twisted wing, I was obliged after setting the limb,
    to restrain him from any further gratification of his mate’s curiosity
    by tying the wing into place, and keeping it so tied, till the bone
    united. The one now attended the other, and carefully examined, day
    after day, the broken limb. Calling on him to make an occasional effort
    to raise the disabled and immovable member, she used her ineffectual
    endeavours to persuade him to lift it, though tied, by lifting her own
    from time to time.</p>

  <p>“Though this fellow-feeling was so strongly and so remarkably
    manifested with regard to the broken wing,—when feeding together, the
    abler female did not hesitate to take advantage of her greater agility,
    by snatching away from her mate his share of victuals, and grappling
    with him for one and the same piece of meat. Instinct seems to exhibit
    simple, not complex emotions. If the male bird had been utterly unable
    to feed himself, the female would, possibly, herself have supplied him
    with food:—but, able to eat, the undivided passion was the feeding
    appetite; and the instinctive habit of striking at the prey, and
    grabbing it, was not capable of restraint, or of any modification
    whatever.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span></p>

  <p>“The Booby has an uncontrollable predilection for elevated spots as
    perching places. If a single stone be higher than others in the yard,
    the Booby’s eye perceives it, and there he takes up his station, and
    stands, when he has fed, and is satisfied. If a log or a bundle of
    wood lie about, he mounts it, and perches upon it to sun himself,
    extending his wings over his tail, and erecting his dorsal feathers
    for the admission of the genial beams of morning. He roosts upon
    similar vantage spots, generally on the tops of the triangular coops
    in which are kept our fattening poultry. He has great prehensile power
    with his foot; and his serrated middle-toe is frequently applied to
    scratch the naked skin about his eyes and face. Our birds are fonder
    of flesh meats, such as beef and pork, than of fish. They dislike fat,
    and generally reject it, if it be given separately from the lean. They
    never drink, and are just as regardless of the water about the yard, as
    if they had been as unadapted for it, as hens and turkeys.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span></p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_131" href="#FNanchor_131" class="label">[131]</a> The following note I received from my friend, since the
      above was prepared for the press. “My male Booby died the other day. I
      found animalcules in the liver. Its anatomy exhibited, in a remarkably
      interesting manner, the fine adaptation for the purposes of buoyancy,
      detailed by Professor Owen in the dissection of the kindred Gannet.
      The muscles showed the air-vessels interspersed among them, in a
      manner altogether surprising. They had the appearance, as he expresses
      it, of being dissected. The bird, in the act of expiring, had almost
      entirely discharged the air from about the chest; but very considerable
      inflation still subsisted in the thighs. The large femoral muscle might
      be said to be almost entirely detached from the enveloping integument.
      The septa of the cells seemed alone to attach it to the adjacent flesh.
      There was no adhesion, but along one of its edges.” The cells were
      strongly united to the skin; and the roots of the feathers protruded
      into the internal cavities, as if they grew out of nothing. The cells
      must have performed their office with marvellous readiness, for the
      nerves were easily traceable among them. The air-vessels were like so
      many colourless bubbles.

    <p>“The bird had died during the night by the side of the coop on which
      they both usually roosted, but without attempting to perch. As I
      removed the dead bird before the other Booby had quitted its morning
      roost, it was interesting to see it, under a sense of loneliness,
      running its head into every opened door, to seek its lost companion.”</p>

  <p>But that the history of the Pelican and the Booby made allusion to
    the roosting place near Bluefields necessary, I should have preferred
    to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>describe it under the present article; for though the trees are
    common to the three species, the former two frequent the place less
    numerously, and less constantly than the Frigates. At most hours of the
    day, one either sees a large number of these birds resting on the lofty
    trees, or else soaring and circling round and round over the place.
    Occasionally, in the middle of the day we see half a dozen sailing at
    an immense height in the air; where their size and colour, the graceful
    freedom of their motions, and the sublimity of their elevation, might
    cause them to be confounded with the John Crow Vulture, were it not for
    the curvature of their wings, the long-pointed tail, often opened and
    closed, and a superior elegance in their general form.</p>

  <p>Being desirous of knowing at what hour the Frigates came home to
    the roosting place, I visited it on several evenings. On the first
    occasion, arriving there just as the sun was setting, I found I was
    not sufficiently early to witness the congregating of the birds,
    for my ears were saluted, even when in the high-road, by the loud
    and unpleasant croaking of the Boobies. On my getting to the foot
    of the first Birch-tree, I could discern many of these sitting on
    the branches; but as the view was much intercepted by the bushes and
    trees around, I scrambled down the shingly precipice, to the sea-side.
    Then on looking up I saw the boughs of the birch immediately over
    my head, studded with these noisy birds, preening their plumage, or
    scolding and fighting harshly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span> with one another, as they sat side by
    side. While thus gazing upward, I narrowly escaped the misfortune of
    Tobit. There may have been thirty Boobies in sight, and about eight
    or ten Frigates, but no Pelicans except three on a tree at a little
    distance. All on a sudden, however, the Frigates flew off as by common
    impulse, accompanied by at least fifty more, which I had not seen, they
    having been concealed by the foliage, or having been sitting on the
    neighbouring trees,—and by as many Boobies, leaving a good number of
    the latter, however, still remaining.</p>

  <p>Though they all flew about in various directions over the sea, they did
    not retire from the vicinity; but the Frigates presently separated from
    the Boobies, taking a loftier elevation, where they sailed and circled
    in silent dignity, while the Boobies were clamorous in their evolutions.</p>

  <p>The latter soon sought their perches again; and this gave rise to
    incessant squabbles, for if a flyer attempted to alight beside a
    sitter, the latter, as if affronted at the intrusion, began, with
    elevated wings and opened beak, to resist, croaking vociferously. The
    Frigates were long before they returned; some sailed out half a mile,
    and there performed their elegant manœuvrings, while others still
    hovered above the roosting trees. Among these some were wholly black,
    some had the white breast of the female sex, and others the white head
    of youth, and one was conspicuous by his blood-red pouch, inflated
    into a tense bladder beneath his chin. From the fact that very few,
    indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span> possess this red pouch, I incline to think it a peculiarity
    of mature age; for many had the livery of the adult male, whose pouch
    was inconspicuous, and of a pale buff hue. At length, as the increased
    darkness gathered in, they also began one by one to settle, very
    charily, often making a feint to alight, and again sailing off. Some
    slowly wended their way farther down the bay, and some I left still in
    the air.</p>

  <p>A few days after, I again went between three and four o’clock, but even
    then the Frigates were reposing in great numbers, but few Boobies, and
    no Pelicans. I shot a Frigate, which of course aroused the whole flock:
    and I then had an opportunity of ascertaining their numbers. As they
    sailed gracefully round, I counted them twice, and both times made
    them about fifty, but of course I could not be quite exact: from other
    observations, I should estimate the number of those which habitually
    repose there to be about sixty, more or less. During an hour and a half
    that I remained, they did not again alight, and when the sun was close
    to the horizon they were still soaring in their sublime evolutions.
    About one sixth of the number were white-headed, their snowy heads and
    breasts gleaming now and then, as the slanting rays were reflected
    from them to the observer; and several displayed the inflated scarlet
    pouch, a little constricted in the middle. As the Frigate flies, the
    form of its wings reminds one of enormous bats, but for the lengthened
    tail. When about to alight, they sometimes cackle a little, but are
    generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span> silent. As they sit on the branches they are incessantly
    employed in picking the vermin from their bodies, with which they are
    much infested. This is done partly with the beak, but partly with the
    foot; and I have seen them, after scratching themselves, put up the
    foot to the beak, apparently delivering something into the mouth.
    Occasionally they throw the head back, and make a loud clattering with
    the beak. Passing along the road one forenoon in May, a large number
    were wheeling round the roosting place, some alighting, and others
    rising. Those which were on the wing uttered, particularly as they
    swooped near the tree, on which they made as if they would alight, a
    repeated <em>chuck</em>, not loud, with a rather rapid iteration.</p>

  <p>It would appear that this place has been frequented by the Frigates,
    for at least a hundred years. Robinson has this note: “On a large
    cotton-tree, between Mr. Wallo’s and the Cave, by the sea-side, come
    to roost many Man-of-war birds, about four o’clock in the evenings,
    which tree may be easily approached by a canoe, whence the Men-of-war
    and other sea-fowl may be shot, either in the evening, or before
    sunrise; for the Man-of-war birds will not leave their roosting-places
    before sunrise, in this resembling the Noddy. Dr. Gorse of Savanna le
    Mar, from whom I had this account, observed that the cotton-tree was
    blanched or whitened by their dung.” (MSS. ii. 83.)</p>

  <p>I have never seen the Frigate fishing; but have frequently found
    flying-fish in its stomach half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span> digested.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Nor have I ever seen
    it attack the Booby, to make it disgorge, though the fishermen of
    Jamaica are familiar with this habit. Dr. Chamberlaine, who apparently
    describes from observation, says of the Frigate, “He is almost always
    a constant attendant upon our fishermen, when pursuing their vocation
    on the sand-banks in Kingston Harbour, or near the Palisados. Over
    their heads it takes its aerial stand, and watches their motions with
    a patience and perseverance the most exemplary. It is upon these
    occasions that the Pelicans, the Gulls, and other sea-birds become its
    associates and companions. These are also found watching with equal
    eagerness and anxiety the issue of the fishermen’s progress, attracted
    to the spot by the sea of living objects immediately beneath them.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_133" href="#FNanchor_133" class="label">[133]</a> An intelligent fisherman, who is in the habit of trading
      about the coast, and to Cuba, asserts that he has often seen the
      Frigates fishing far out at sea; such large fishes as Bonito, that
      leap out of water, being their prey; which they catch with the foot,
      plunging down on them, and then mounting, deliver the booty to the
      mouth like a Parrot. I feel it right to repeat this statement, though I
      think it improbable, from the weakness of the foot. He adds that they
      breed in great numbers on the Pedro Kays, laying on the bare rocks.
  </div>

  <p>“And then it is, when these men are making their last haul, and the
    finny tribe are fluttering and panting for life, that this voracious
    bird exhibits his fierce and pugnacious propensities. His hungry
    companions have scarcely secured their prey by the side of the
    fishermen’s canoes, when with the lightning’s dart, they are pounced
    upon with such violence, that, to escape its rapacious assaults, they
    readily in turn yield their hard-earned booty to this formidable
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>opponent. The lightness of its trunk, the short tarsi, and vast
    spread of wing, together with its long, slender, and forked tail, all
    conspire to give him a superiority over his tribe, not only in length
    and rapidity of flight, but also in the power of maintaining itself on
    outspread pinions in the regions of his aerial habitation amidst the
    clouds; where, at times, so lofty are its soarings, its figure becomes
    almost invisible to the spectator in this nether world.” (Jamaica Alm.
    1843, p. 87.)</p>

  <p>I know nothing positive of the nidification of the Frigate. On the face
    of Pedro Bluff, about four feet from the surface of the sea, which,
    however, in stormy weather dashes furiously into it, there is a hole
    into which a man may crawl, but which, within, widens into a spacious
    cavern. A person who had visited this place, told me that on its floor
    lie the skulls and bones of men, mouldering in damp and decay; the
    relics, probably of some of the unfortunate Indians, who preferred
    death by famine to the tortures and cruelties of the Spaniards. To
    this cave, he affirmed, the Frigates and Pelicans resort to lay their
    eggs; depositing them on the projecting ledges and shelves of the soft
    and marly rock. On my way up to Kingston from Bluefields in June,
    lying windbound under the Pedro, I induced a white man residing there
    to accompany me to the face of the Bluff, where he said the Pelicans
    and Frigates roosted, and where the former built and laid. After
    walking about a mile in the most burning heat, through cacti, aloes,
    and spinous bushes, a most peculiar vegetation, and over the sharp
    needle-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span> points of honey-comb limestone, occasionally leaping deep
    clefts, we came to the spot. Many birds of both kinds were sitting on
    the low stunted trees, but we could not find a single nest nor eggs;
    though, as my guide said, at some times they were numerous, but only of
    the Pelican; of the Frigate’s nidification he knew nothing.</p>

  <p>The gular pouch of the old male, is not connected with the mouth,
    like that of the Pelican, but appears to be an air-cell; perhaps
    having some analogy to the erectile caruncles of the male Turkey. If
    we take the skeleton of the Pelican as a standard, the sternum of the
    Frigate is greatly developed <em>laterally</em>, as that of the Booby
    is, <em>longitudinally</em>. The middle claw is pectinated. I think I
    know of no bird so infested with entozoic worms as the Frigate. Immense
    bunches both of tænoid and cylindrical worms are found in almost
    every specimen, besides some curious kinds apparently of a higher
    organization. Bird-lice and bird-flies also infest it.</p>

  <p>One which was wounded, on being taken up, was fierce, endeavouring to
    seize with his beak. And a specimen kept alive by Dr. Chamberlaine,
    became animated and pugnacious when the children or servants approached
    it, and struck at them with its formidable bill.</p>

  <p>The bird which Robinson has described (MSS. ii. 124,) in the terms
    quoted below, is doubtless to be referred to this species, though from
    the shortness of the tail-feathers, and the colour of the beak and
    feet, I presume it to have been an immature specimen. He describes
    its habits as resembling those of the Terns: it was brought to him
    alive, having been knocked off a fish-pot-buoy; he kept it almost a
    week, feeding it with the offal of fish, which it ate greedily. When
    it attempted to walk, it spread its wings, and waddled along with much
    difficulty, which arose not only from the backward position of its
    legs, but also from their shortness and weakness. Sometimes it made a
    chattering noise, like the Belted Kingfisher, and it had another cry,
    not unlike that of a Gull. It would bite, upon occasion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span> very hard.
    The head and neck were very big in proportion.</p>

  <p>It is mentioned to me as one of the constant frequenters of the Pedro Kays.</p>

  <p>This large and beautiful Tern is the most common species we have in
    the vicinity of Bluefields. Its powerful beak of a bright orange hue,
    its pointed occipital crests of black, the pearly tint of its upper,
    and the satiny lustre of its under parts, constitute it a species of
    much beauty. In the autumn months we may frequently see this bird
    fishing. A quarter of a mile from the shore, off Crabpond Point, there
    is a reef, above which it may be seen almost every day. Quite solitary
    in his habits, the Crested Tern prefers to fish alone; and though
    sometimes two or three may be in view at once, there is no association,
    no accordance of movement, as in the Pelicans. High above the water,
    we discern a bird, the snowy whiteness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span> of whose plumage contrasts
    with the blue sky; he flies rapidly round and round in a large circle,
    quickly flapping his wings without intermission. Suddenly, he arrests
    his flight, flutters his wings in rapid vibration, as he looks
    downwards, but in a moment proceeds as before: it was doubtless a
    fish near the surface, but which disappeared before he could descend.
    Presently he again stops short, flutters,—then bringing the elbow
    of the wings to a right angle, descends perpendicularly, but with a
    singular turning of the body, so as to present now the back, now the
    belly, alternately, to the observer; not, however, by a rotation, but
    irregularly, and as if by jerks. But his purpose is again frustrated;
    for on nearly reaching the surface, he recovers himself with a graceful
    sweep, and remounts on flagging wing. Again he circles; and again, and
    again stops: at length, down he swoops, disappears with a plash, and in
    a moment breaks, struggling, from the wave, and, as if to rise burdened
    with prey were difficult, flags heavily near the surface, and circling
    slowly round, gradually regains his former altitude. Suddenly,—as if
    alarmed, though nothing appears to cause it,—he utters two or three
    loud cries in a plaintive tone, and flies off, along the coast, until
    he is concealed from view by the projecting mangroves. Yet, strange
    to say, in a few seconds he returns, and calmly pursues his wonted
    occupation. When satiated, he betakes himself to some one of the logs
    of wood which are placed as buoys by the fishermen to mark the position
    of their sunken fish-pots; and on this he reposes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span> all night, rocked to
    sleep by the roll of the surf. The fishermen, on visiting their pots
    at early day, find the Terns, exceedingly often, sitting on the buoys;
    and so fearless are they, that not seldom a canoe may be paddled nearly
    within touch of one before he will fly.</p>

  <p>Though web-footed, I believe none of the Terns are ever seen to swim.
    One shot and wounded in the wing made no effort to strike out, but
    merely struggled in the water as a land-bird would do. This specimen
    was brought home alive; it attempted to bite, striking with the beak.
    The flesh was dark, and resembled that of a Duck.</p>

  </div>

  <p>For my information concerning this species, I am principally indebted
    to Mr. Hill; a single specimen only having fallen into my possession,
    which was shot by Sam, sitting on a fish-pot buoy near Bluefields, in
    the manner of the former species.</p>

  <p>It is, however, a bird of considerable commercial importance; for its
    eggs, in common with those <span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>of the Noddy (<i id="Megalopterus_stolidus">Megalopterus stolidus</i>)
    and the Sandwich Tern (<i id="Thalasseus_Cantiacus">Thalasseus Cantiacus</i>) form an object of
    profitable adventure to the crews of numerous small vessels, fitted
    out in the spring from Kingston and other ports. The Pedro Kays are
    the grand field whence this harvest is reaped. “These lonely islets,”
    observes Mr. Hill, “are the resort of thousands and tens of thousands
    of sea-fowl. As soon as visitors land, myriads of birds are upon the
    wing in all directions. Some flocks rise, in circling flight, high up
    into the air; and descending again in the same dense numbers as they
    rose, settle in more remote places:—others break away hurriedly, and
    fly in a wide sweep far around, but return again hastily to the rocks
    they had quitted, reconciled to bear with the disturbance. The turmoil
    and hubbub of the thousands of birds thus suddenly put upon the wing,
    overpower, for a moment, the roar of the breakers, and darken the air
    like the sudden passing of a cloud.</p>

  <p>“The constant inhabitants of the rocks are some three species of
    Gannet, all known as Boobies; some half a dozen species of Tern, among
    which the Noddy and the Egg-bird are exceedingly numerous; together
    with the Frigate Pelican, the Tropic-bird, and the Petrel; besides a
    multitude of Gulls....</p>

  <p>“There were four vessels from Jamaica there at this time [April, 1846]
    gathering eggs; the months of March, April, and May being considered
    the egg-harvest.</p>

  <p>“The Kays are open to all adventurers; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span> egg-gathering is
    regulated by a custom which recognises the first-coming vessel as
    commanding for the season. The second vessel in seniority is called
    the Commodore; the first being styled the Admiral. They have a code
    of laws, to which, in a spirit of honourable compliance, all are
    expected to shew obedience; and in case of any infraction of the
    obligations thus voluntarily imposed upon themselves, a jury selected
    from the several vessels try complaints, and with due formality inflict
    punishment for offences.</p>

  <p>“The only kind of vegetation, excepting a single cocoa-nut, on
    these desert rocks, is a stunted tree, called by the egg-gatherers
    <em>saffron-wood</em>. It is extremely resinous, and the leaves are
    used by them as tea; and I suspect it is the same plant as the
    <em>tea-shrub</em> of the Bahama islands. Among the branches of these
    trees, at a very small elevation from the ground, the Noddies build
    nests, that have become large by a long accumulation of dung and
    sticks. The nests are resorted to for a succession of years, and are
    repaired and raised upon, season after season, till they have grown
    into huge piles, among the branches;—the large masses of interwoven
    twigs prevailing even more than the green foliage. The Egg-bird and the
    Sandwich Tern, if they are unable to gather any of the dead foliage
    of these shrubs, or any dried leaves of sea-weed, as a covering for
    the cavity in the rock in which <em>they</em> nestle, lay their eggs on
    the bare sand: just making so much of a depression by scratching the
    ground as suffices to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span> hollow it for the reception of some three eggs,
    the addition of the <em>urate of lime</em> from their dung sufficiently
    cementing the loose particles.”</p>

  <p>In a subsequent communication my friend reverts to the same interesting
    subject. “The nests of the Noddy, which, though so elaborately framed
    with sticks, are exceedingly shallow, with scarce any hollowing
    at all, are always embellished with an addition of broken shells,
    (<em>sea-shells</em>,) generally speckled and spotted like the eggs. Mr.
    Wilkie examined them, and they were sea-shells. The obvious suggestion
    for this curious prevalence of a habit, which he found to distinguish
    <em>every nest</em>, was its deceptiveness; so much similarity existed
    between the sea-shell and the egg-shell. I find that Audubon records a
    similar fact with the Noddy Terns of the Florida Kays. These are his
    words: ‘In a great many instances, the repaired nests formed masses
    nearly two feet in height, and yet all of them had only a slight
    hollow for the eggs, <em>broken shells of</em> <span class="smcap">which</span> <em>were
    found among the entire, as if they had been purposely</em> <span class="smcap">placed
    there</span>.’ Mr. Wilkie was totally unacquainted with this noticed
    particular in Audubon’s ‘Ornithological Biography.’ Has Audubon
    misread his note ‘<em>broken shells</em>,’ and by the following words
    ‘of which,’ made them <em>egg-shells</em>, when they should have been
    <em>sea-shells</em>? This is at least worth a remark. Mr. Wilkie says he
    took the pieces of shell out of the nest, and inspected them. Audubon
    merely says, ‘The bushes rarely were taller than ourselves, so that we
    could easily <em>see the eggs in the nest</em>.’”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span></p>

  <p>Specimens of the eggs of these three species of Tern, procured at the
    Kays by George Wilkie, Esq., who kindly furnished the above information
    to Mr. Hill for the benefit of this work, are now before me. There
    is scarcely any difference in size, the dimensions being 2 inches by
    1³⁄₈: the Noddy’s, however, is of a more conical form. The ground
    of all is white; that of the Noddy has a few blackish specks thinly
    scattered over it, and at the larger end some irregular splashes of
    brown. That of the Sandwich Tern is uniformly speckled with dull
    reddish-purple; while that of the Egg-bird is marked with the same hue
    in fewer but larger spots.</p>

  <hr class="tb">

  <p>To the above <i>Laridæ</i>, Mr. Hill adds <i id="Sterna_argentea">Sterna argentea</i>
    (<span class="smcap">Bonap.</span>) killed in Kingston Harbour; and <i id="Hydrochelidon_nigra">Hydrochelidon
    nigra</i> (<span class="smcap">Boie</span>) and <i id="Xema_atricilla">Xema atricilla</i> (<span class="smcap">Bonap.</span>)
    as frequenting the Kays.</p>

  <p>Of two other birds he thus gives me indications:—“A curious bird of the
    family <i id="PROCELLARIADAE">Procellariadæ</i> (the Petrels,) was found in the Rio Grande
    in Portland after the late storms [in the autumn of 1846.] Hurricanes
    introduce into these islands new birds, and disperse those peculiar
    to these islands into other localities.” The other seems to be of
    the family <i id="ALCADAE">Alcadæ</i> (the Auks). “In the Blue Mountains, high up
    towards their summits, is a curious <em>burrowing</em> bird, which they
    call the Blue-Mountain Duck. It is described as having webbed feet,
    and a hooked parrot-bill. This description would indicate a species of
    <i>Alca</i>. It inhabits holes in the cliffs, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span> said to burrow
    to the extent of ten feet. Nothing is known of its habit of feeding.
    E. M<sup>c</sup>Geachy, Esq., Crown Surveyor for the county of Surrey, first
    informed me of the existence of such birds. He had himself taken them
    from their burrows. The facts have also been assured to me by other
    observers.” A specimen of this bird is said to be in the possession
    of George Atkinson, Esq., of Newcastle-on-Tyne, who, in answer to an
    application from me, kindly promised me a particular description; but
    other engagements, probably, have not yet afforded him the necessary
    leisure.</p>

  <p>No living specimen of this bird has fallen under my notice. It is,
    however, familiar to Mr. Hill, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>who kindly favoured me with a preserved
    specimen, and with some of his own notes. It is frequently shot in
    the Rio Cobre. One which Mr. Hill had alive was put into a barrel
    half filled with straw, on which was laid a large pan of water; the
    brevity of its wings precluding the possibility of its getting out. It
    was reconciled immediately; and fed heartily on raw fish chopped up.
    It lived in apparent health three weeks, and died at length without
    manifest illness, or any perceptible cause; though want of exercise or
    alteration of diet may have contributed to it.</p>

  <p>A few further particulars of the habits of this same individual are
    contained in a recent letter from my friend. “The several specimens of
    the Black-gorget Grebe that I have had, were brought to me from the
    sedgy grounds of the River Cobre. Usually the banks of the river are
    deep; but there are places in which the course of the stream has been
    changed, leaving, between one channel and the other, open meadows and
    banks fringed with a bristling growth of cyperaceous and other border
    herbage. It will be readily perceived, that these stretches of blended
    sward and sedge are the only parts of the river fitted for a bird with
    fin-toed feet and short wings, to quit the water and seek the shore. It
    is only there they can rise out of the stream upon the green turf; and
    there they indulge in slumbers <span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>in the sunshine, secluded and secure.
    I judge this to be their habit, from the pleasure a bird I kept some
    few weeks alive used to feel in lying on the weeds placed for him by
    the side of a bowl of water, in which he fed. He would there repose for
    hour after hour, doubled up like an antelope on the grass, with its
    head and neck curved,—if I may compare beings so dissimilar,—in the
    graceful attitude in which I made my drawing, now in the hands of the
    Zoological Society. The food given to my bird was Guinea-corn. After it
    had been softened in the water, it ate it readily. The seeds of aquatic
    plants may be considered, therefore, quite as much as water insects
    and mollusca, its accustomed food. The eye, which is dark and bright,
    like a gazelle’s, has a thick orbit of that fleshy character, to which
    pigeon-fanciers give the name of <em>putty-eye</em>, in their favourite
    birds.”</p>

    Edgecumbe, which, though not more than an acre or two in extent, used
    to be speckled with a good number of these miniature ducks; their
    little black heads and the tops of their backs alone being visible
    above the surface. On the slightest alarm, they dive with the quickness
    of thought; and so vigilant is their eye and so rapid their motion,
    that, ordinarily, the fowling-piece is discharged at them in vain. It
    is commonly said of some birds, that they dive at the flash of the pan;
    but though I always used percussion-locks, I could never succeed in
    hitting one, until I formed a screen of bushes, behind which I might
    fire in concealment. I then found no difficulty. Hence, I infer that
    their quick eye detects and takes alarm at the small but sudden motion
    of the falling hammer. They remain long, and swim far, under water;
    coming up where quite unlooked for. Some that I have had an opportunity
    of observing when swimming a little beneath the surface, shot along
    with expanded wings, almost with the celerity of a fish. They do not
    always dive, however, when frightened; sometimes they sink deeper than
    before, and swim away almost submerged. When not alarmed, they call and
    answer each other, with a loud <em>clang</em>, like the note of a trumpet.</p>

  <p>One of these birds which I had wounded slightly, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>on being put into a
    large washing-bowl half filled with water, swam awhile; but repeatedly,
    when alarmed, by striking vigorously with both feet together, leaped
    clean over the edge of the basin. When on the floor, it ran a few
    steps at a time, very well, but grotesquely; the body elevated on the
    legs almost perpendicularly; but ever and anon, as its first impetus
    slackened, it fell on its breast, and sometimes rolled over. After a
    while, however, becoming more calm, it walked more easily, still much
    raised on the legs; but would suddenly squat down on the belly, and so
    remain.</p>

  <p>Early in August, I found near the edge of Mount Edgecumbe pond a nest
    of this Grebe—a round heap of pond-weed and rotten leaves, flattened at
    the top, and slightly hollowed; it was about fifteen inches wide, and
    six or eight thick. The top was damp, but not wet, and very warm from
    exposure to the sun’s rays. We drew it on shore, for it was entangled
    among the branches of a fallen tree, but <em>not attached</em> to them,
    and presently found on the matted weed, just below the surface in the
    place where we had dragged it, a large white egg, excessively begrimed
    with dirt, doubtless from lying on the decaying leaves. On being
    cleansed, I found it covered with a chalky coat, easily scratched off.</p>

  <p>A few weeks after, I again visited this pond. On approaching before
    sun-rise, (for I had travelled by the brilliant starlight of the
    tropical heavens,) I saw a Grebe sitting on a new nest, in the same
    spot as I had found the former one: this nest was composed of similar
    materials, and contained four eggs. Early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span> in December we found another
    nest, with the young just peeping from the egg. It is probable,
    therefore, that several broods are reared in a season.</p>

  <p>One of my lads, who has lived close by this pond, affirms that the
    birds move the nest about to different parts of the pond; and that they
    use the same till it will no longer hold together, and then construct
    a new one. He also states that they often fight during the night; and
    that the conquered ones resort to a smaller pond, where they may be
    easily captured by hand: for, by chasing them to and fro, the small
    pond being shallow, they at length become wearied, and will dive no
    more, but make for the shore, and are caught before they can fly.</p>

  <p>The flesh is dark and oily. The gizzards of all that I obtained were
    filled with a finely comminuted substance, rather dry, of an unctuous
    appearance, and mingled with short silky filaments. A close examination
    with a lens failed to determine its nature; but I believe it to have
    been principally vegetable.</p>

  <hr class="tb2">

  <p>The author, in bringing to a close these notices of “The Birds
    of Jamaica,” craves the indulgence of his readers to make an
    observation on the use of such studies. The Christian is taught,
    whatsoever he does, to do all “to the glory of God;” and as “whoso
    offereth <em>praise</em> glorifieth” Him, the constant object of our
    investigations should be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span> bringing out to view fresh proofs of
    His unspeakable wisdom, skill, power, forethought, care, and love,
    in the creation, preservation, and sustentation of His creatures.
    The gratification of scientific curiosity is worse than idle, if it
    leads not to this: whatever exactness of knowledge we may acquire,
    or whatever scientific skilfulness we may attain, is, without this
    result, “but shaping letters aright without learning to know their
    signification and value.” “It is <em>God appearing in the creatures</em>,
    that is the life, and beauty, and use, and excellency of all the
    creatures;—without Him they are but carcases, deformed, useless, vain,
    insignificant, and very nothings.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

    <span class="xlarge">THE CANADIAN NATURALIST.</span><br>
    <br>
    A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS ON THE NATURAL HISTORY OF<br>
    LOWER CANADA.<br>
    <br>
    BY PHILIP HENRY GOSSE,<br>
    <br>
    <span class="xsmall">COR. MEM. OF THE NAT. HIST. SOC. OF MONTREAL, AND OF THE<br>
    LIT. AND HIST. SOC. OF QUEBEC.</span>
  </div>

  <p>This volume is the result of a residence of several years in Lower
    Canada, and contains brief and popular notices of subjects in the
    different departments of Natural History, not systematically arranged,
    but as observed by the Author when wandering in the fields and woods.
    Some of the more prominent phenomena of natural philosophy; the habits
    of quadrupeds, birds, and insects; the general appearance, time
    of flowering, &amp;c. of plants, are briefly described in the form of
    dialogue, interspersed with characteristic anecdotes; embracing the
    course of the seasons throughout the year, and presenting to the reader
    a picture of the face of nature in that interesting country.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Were we to attempt to make extracts to show the beauties of this
      fascinating work, we should reprint the whole. We have rarely
      met with information so delightfully conveyed, and in so small a
      compass. The illustrations are worthy of the letter-press, and this
      is giving them no small praise. The ‘Canadian Naturalist’ will be
      as popular as White’s Natural History of Selborne.”—<i>Church of
      England Quarterly Review.</i></p>

    <p>“The volume, however, has the great merit of reality; its materials
      are drawn direct from nature; there is also about many parts of it
      a peculiar charm, which reminds one of White’s Selborne. The pages
      are embellished by pictures of trees, animals, insects, flowers,
      &amp;c., that to the ordinary merit of beauty of execution join the
      rare quality of distinctly-expressed character.”—<i>Spectator.</i></p>

    <p>“We have seldom seen a work so deeply imbued with the same
      acuteness and accuracy of observation, and healthful tone of
      feeling, as the one now before us. It is replete with information,
      interesting not merely to the naturalist, but often to the
      agriculturist, and the political economist.”—<i>Christian
      Remembrancer.</i></p>
